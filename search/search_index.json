Please go to v1engineering.com for the up to date and accurate instructions. at v1engineering.com Basics \u00b6 The Dual EndStop firmware update enables unprecedented precision more easily than ever before. Since day one I have never encouraged endstops be used, until now. The Mostly Printed CNC and LowRider CNC are unique in the fact that two of the axes are powered at each end of the axis. Using this fact and the new dual endstop firmware we can now more precisely and accurately set the position of every single stepper on the machine independently. This should reliably give you repeat-ability on the order of your endstops resolution, even after powering off. Before this new firmware update all the machines in this category relied 100% on the users build accuracy, or manual measuring. This involves setting of each axis before engaging the steppers and locking it in place. If the steppers are ever disengaged during use only the side of the axis with an endstop can accurately be accounted for. This makes fixturing, tool changes, and multi-day jobs extremely difficult to get repeatable results. A poor build or lack of axis alignment before each job will result in a non square skewed axis. A skewed axis will result in ovals and parallelograms instead of circles and 90\u00b0 cornered rectangles. Changes in build accuracy due to use and environmental conditions need to be adjusted out or accounted for manually. Now just a minor offset adjustment will correct this. Plugging In The Steppers \u00b6 Remapping of pins is used in the firmware to allow the use of all the control boards drivers. The unused extruder driver/s are used for the extra stepper/s. Ramps \u00b6 Mini-RAMBo \u00b6 This board only has 4 drivers available and can easily be used with the LowRider CNC but can not full take advantage of the new firmware with the MPCNC. Archim \u00b6 RAMBo \u00b6 Endstops \u00b6 The min pins are used as normal for the first stepper and the max pins are used for the second stepper on that axis, still as a min. For example, X1 pairs with Xmin, X2 pairs with Xmax. DO NOT USE THE + (positive) Terminal. S & \u2013 (signal and Negative) Only Xmin=X1 limit switch Xmax=X2 limit switch Ymin=Y1 limit Switch Ymax=Y2 Limit switch Zmin=Touch probe. Signal pin to plate, negative to tool. For the safest configuration the endstops should be wired in the Normally Closed position (NC), to prevent wire disconnects from damaging the machine during the homing sequence. Mechanical endstops are connected to the signal and ground pins filtered or optical endstops use all three pins, connect these with extreme caution. Using the wrongs pins will damage your control board. Optical endstops are not recommended on a machine used for milling or routing. The debris can inhibit there function. I made modified a few parts to keep the wiring clean, Clean Dual Mounts . Mini-RAMBo \u00b6 This board only has 4 drivers available and can easily be used with the LowRider CNC (Y axis) but can not full take advantage of the new firmware with the MPCNC. RAMBo \u00b6 Pay attention the pins are opposite each other, but clearly labeled on the board. Archim \u00b6 Ramps \u00b6 Firmware \u00b6 The dual endstop firmware is on the V1 Engineering Marlin GitHub page. Remember small 1mm moves when initially powering it up, if driving your steppers the wrong way you can rip your machine apart. If your steppers are moving the wrong direction, completely power off your board before flipping the plug over. In case you have never used GitHub, the first drop down lets you select the firmware version you want. The next step is download the firmware you selected. Click on \u201cClone or Download\u201d, then click on \u201cDownload Zip\u201d. Testing and Calibration \u00b6 After all the endstops have been connected issuing a M119 command will let you see the current status of each endstop. You should check that each endstop registers both an open and closed status before proceeding. Open when not touching and closed when they are. You can test them individually by closing each one by hand and running an M119 . Also verify the X1 corresponds to the X1 stepper. Then verify a positive movement is away from the end stops. The unfortunately designated M666 lets you test your offset to quickly calibrate your machine. Using the command M666 X0.72 would offset the X1 stepper 0.72mm away from it\u2019s endstop, Y! can also be used. To verify your current settings during calibration just an M666 will show the current offsets. Once the correct offset are found you should input them into your firmware. This is to simplify the actual placement of the endstops themselves, you only need to get them such that the X1 or Y1 endstop is at or slightly behind where it needs to be within a few Millimeters is best. You can verify how square your axis is by measuring the diagonals of the largest rectangle you can draw in your build area. The larger the more accurate\u2026but also harder to measure. I only have 6\u2033 calipers but I was more accurate with a tape measure at my 440mm available diagonal. Measure the diagonals to the X1 and Y1 endstops blocks. Offset the endstop that has the short dimension by the amount it is short or just a hair over. So if the X1 diagonal was 1mm short you would offset X1 by 1mm. M666 X1. Tip \u2013 If it is more than 2mm off move the stop block, each belt tooth is 2mm. Draw a fresh one to verify. If that is correct you should edit your firmware to make this change permanent in configuration.h Or add it to all of your Gcode. Enjoy! Care should be taken to use as little pen pressure as possible with the finest tip possible to get the most accurate results and a pen mount with some give should be used, example pen mount . My trials and tribulations figuring this out\u2026.Feel free to make fun of me. Forum link . Use \u00b6 First, most jobs will not benefit from using endstops. Getting the machine close and just running a quick one off carving or sign has no need to go through all the extra steps. People new to the CNC world should not use this, this is a advanced technique. My support for this will be limited. You can now use the machine in two ways. Quick one off jobs as you always would setting the home position by hand and just running the job. Or by starting each job with a G28 (if using a touch plate) you can now reference or return to that position at any time. If you are not using a touch plate you can use G28 X Y You can use fixtures at a set reference points on the table to do repeat jobs or multiple sided cuts utilizing CAM based work offsets or scripts. Tool changes can be done with multiple gcodes so you can do repeat jobs in order of bit used instead of per piece depending on if changing the part of the bit is the faster choice. Jobs can be restarted in case of power outage, tool breaks, long multi day jobs, apply paint between cuts, etc. If you don\u2019t need the endstops you can just insert the command, G92 X0 Y0 Z0 , in your gcode before the cut starts. This should allow for normal use without homing or work offsets, also no squaring. For more info please see the Milling Basics page. Work offsets \u00b6 Make sure your job has a work offset if you use the endstops. A typical part has the gcode built with the origin at the parts corner. If you where to cut out that part it would result in going negative past your endstops and misalign your machine. Negative moves do not work on the X and Y axis with endstops. Moving the origin in your CAM program is the easiest fix. To get a more precise work offset it is best to add it in your CAD file. This can be done with a bounding box, cut it as a separate path and used to position your material. How it is done in the firmware \u00b6 Marlin currently has to have at least one extruder defined, this extruder causes us an issue has we need the driver it is assigned to. All boards have and E0 driver (some call it something different), and dual firmware capable boards also have an E1 driver, beyond that most boards have breakout pins for more external drivers. The first extruder gets assigned to driver E0. To make this all work I change pin assignments for E0 to one of the external break pins change the current E1 pins to the E0 driver, and create an E2 set and assign them the pins of the E1 driver. I hope that makes sense, I move E0 pin assingments out of the way and shuffle E1 and E2 down one slot. All of this happens in the Pins/Pins_XXXX.h files. XXXX=whatever board you are using.","title":"Dual Endstops"},{"location":"electronics/dual-endstops/#auto-square-dual-endstops","text":"Warning These documents are not yet the official documents.

You should check that each endstop registers both an open and closed status before proceeding. Open when not touching and closed when they are. You can test them individually by closing each one by hand and running an M119 . Also verify the X1 corresponds to the X1 stepper. Then verify a positive movement is away from the end stops. The unfortunately designated M666 lets you test your offset to quickly calibrate your machine. Using the command M666 X0.72 would offset the X1 stepper 0.72mm away from it\u2019s endstop, Y! can also be used. To verify your current settings during calibration just an M666 will show the current offsets. Once the correct offset are found you should input them into your firmware. This is to simplify the actual placement of the endstops themselves, you only need to get them such that the X1 or Y1 endstop is at or slightly behind where it needs to be within a few Millimeters is best. You can verify how square your axis is by measuring the diagonals of the largest rectangle you can draw in your build area. The larger the more accurate\u2026but also harder to measure. I only have 6\u2033 calipers but I was more accurate with a tape measure at my 440mm available diagonal. Measure the diagonals to the X1 and Y1 endstops blocks. Offset the endstop that has the short dimension by the amount it is short or just a hair over. So if the X1 diagonal was 1mm short you would offset X1 by 1mm. M666 X1. Tip \u2013 If it is more than 2mm off move the stop block, each belt tooth is 2mm. Draw a fresh one to verify. If that is correct you should edit your firmware to make this change permanent in configuration.h Or add it to all of your Gcode. Enjoy! Care should be taken to use as little pen pressure as possible with the finest tip possible to get the most accurate results and a pen mount with some give should be used, example pen mount .

Getting the machine close and just running a quick one off carving or sign has no need to go through all the extra steps. People new to the CNC world should not use this, this is a advanced technique. My support for this will be limited. You can now use the machine in two ways. Quick one off jobs as you always would setting the home position by hand and just running the job. Or by starting each job with a G28 (if using a touch plate) you can now reference or return to that position at any time. If you are not using a touch plate you can use G28 X Y You can use fixtures at a set reference points on the table to do repeat jobs or multiple sided cuts utilizing CAM based work offsets or scripts. Tool changes can be done with multiple gcodes so you can do repeat jobs in order of bit used instead of per piece depending on if changing the part of the bit is the faster choice. Jobs can be restarted in case of power outage, tool breaks, long multi day jobs, apply paint between cuts, etc. If you don\u2019t need the endstops you can just insert the command, G92 X0 Y0 Z0 , in your gcode before the cut starts. This should allow for normal use without homing or work offsets, also no squaring.

A typical part has the gcode built with the origin at the parts corner. If you where to cut out that part it would result in going negative past your endstops and misalign your machine. Negative moves do not work on the X and Y axis with endstops. Moving the origin in your CAM program is the easiest fix. To get a more precise work offset it is best to add it in your CAD file. This can be done with a bounding box, cut it as a separate path and used to position your material.","title":"Work offsets"},{"location":"electronics/dual-endstops/#how-it-is-done-in-the-firmware","text":"Marlin currently has to have at least one extruder defined, this extruder causes us an issue has we need the driver it is assigned to.

The first extruder gets assigned to driver E0. To make this all work I change pin assignments for E0 to one of the external break pins change the current E1 pins to the E0 driver, and create an E2 set and assign them the pins of the E1 driver.

That is all you need to spend, throw in a few endmills and you are still under $500. There is no other machine more versatile than the Mostly Printed CNC at any price point. Specs\u2026 \u00b6 Not easy to make a specs page when it can have most any specs you want. The idea behind this is to be extremely adaptable and inexpensive. Why buy a single use machine when you can have one that does it all for less than the cost of any single function machine. No proprietary hardware or software, build it any size and shape you want (more on this later), buy it from this site or source it all yourself, helpful forums, low cost, and capable. What more could you ask for? This machine can easily do many things, how about making some coffee with Apach\u2026(not me but I think he is my new hero). Size \u00b6 All axis can be any length you prefer, anything over 3 \u00bd\u2032 (1M) would require small mid-span supports to increase rigidity, of course smaller is better. The kit comes with enough belt for up to 48\u2033 of total outer X and Y axis dimensions (eg 24\u2033x24\u2033, 36\u2033x12\u2033 or any other combination). The smaller you make this the faster you can move it and the more rigid/accurate it will be, and more importantly the easier it will be to get the desired accuracy. The linear motion is ball bearings on electrical conduit (or stainless steel)\u2026 seriously, easy to use and source. More information on this here . If this machine isn\u2019t big enough I have also designed the LowRider CNC , all the same specs and resolution just designed to be bigger! Power \u00b6 X and Y axis are powered by 2 stepper motors each, and a single stepper for the Z axis. The standard would be NEMA 17 in any torque preferably 42 OZ/in and above (the kit come with 76 OZ/in). No need for NEMA 23\u2019s or their required larger drivers, torque is not one of this machines issues. Belts are used for there accuracy and price. Small belts are used because each axis has two of them. Ballscrews are expensive, require tuning, and periodic maintenance / adjustments. Control \u00b6 This is all controlled by any control board you like. The UltiMachine boards are recommended for the improved design and robust safety features. You can still use the common Ramps 1.4 or any others boards as well. There are other Marlin based boards, GRBL , and regular CNC boards as well. Software \u00b6 There are plenty of free or really inexpensive software options available for 3D printing, CAM, and CAD. I suggest Fusion 360 , Repetier-host , ESTLCam , ect.

Make sure these nuts don\u2019t interfere with the small nut slots, if they do put the small nuts in now. Put all the rollers on their rails and make sure they all slide equally well. There should be tension when inserting the rail and all the bearings should touch. Roller Matched Pairs \u00b6 This is showing the pairs for the X and Y axis. It should be one Roller and one RollerM. It does not matter which way the gantry rail angle is facing as long as it is facing the same as its counterpart. Roller and RollerM are just a mirrored set, made to help with printer deficiencies.

Pre-thread the nylocks to loosen them up a bitx then just wedge a small flathead screwdriver in there and tighten it. No big deal. This is not going to change, we have metric and imperial hardware to account for. I do not want to maintain two sets of every part for something that gets done one time. XY \u00b6 XY part, 4 1.25\u2033 bolts (M8 x 30), nuts, and bearings. Assemble these as shown with the heads out. Do it for both XY parts. These bolts can get snugged up and should not be touched again. These bolts can get snugged up and should not be touched again. Using the 1.5\u2033 (M8 x x40) bolts, nuts and bearings assemble these into the end of the XY parts that only have 1 hole. As shown on the picture on the right the heads should be put in in opposite directions (purely cosmetic), when assembling later these heads should face up. Tension Bolts A \u2013 Control X and Y Rail tension, slight effect on the squareness. More on this at the end. These should be left extremely loose, just tight enough to engage the nylock on the lock nuts. Tension Bolt \u201cB\u201d \u00b6 This step uses the XY, XYZ, Lock Nut, 5\u2033 (M8 x 130) bolt, 2 bearing, both gantry spacers, and a nut. The 5\u2033 (M8 X 130) bolt goes through the XYZ plate. Next is a gantry spacer. Add the XY piece, align it with the hole on the side of the XYZ piece. Insert a bearing into the XY piece. The second XY piece is added to the stack, again lining up the side hole. The second bearing is then added. Add the second Gantry spacer. The second XYZ piece is next, upside down as compared to the first. Like face to like face. Followed by the lock nut. The lock nut should be kept loose , just engage the nylon. This 5\u2033 (130mm) bolt is Tension bolt B. Add in the brass T8 nut and secure with 1 or more M3x10 screw These screws only prevent the nut from turning no need to over tighten or fill all four holes. It is best to actually leave these a little loose to allow the nut to have better alignment with the screw. Seat them all the way and back off a half turn. Tension Bolts C(x4) \u00b6 Use the 4, 2.5\u2033 (M8 x 65) bolts, bearings and lock nuts. These are Tension Bolts C. These should be left extremely loose, just just slightly touching the plastic. Squaring \u00b6 Now that the assembly is complete, this is the best time to double check to make sure the rails are perpendicular. An inexpensive square works just fine. Both of the ones pictured were about $5. Insert all 4 rails into the assembly (X, Y, and The Z assembly). The least amount of tension on the rails is best. At this point, with all the tension bolts loose the rails they should actually be a snug fit, if they are not post some pictures in the forums so we can help. Tension bolts \u201cC\u201d should have the locknuts and the bolt heads tightened so they are just touching the plastic. Equal light tension keeps the Z axis perpendicular to the work surface and locks the assembly together. Use a square to see if your XY rails are, perpendicular. You can tension bolts \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d to adjust the rail angle. It is best to adjust by loosening them. If they are already loose tightening them slightly moves the rail away from the tension bolt. I\u2019m sorry there is no magic bullet for this part. For most people this should go together square as is, but if you are having issues you might just want to run it as is for a while and then try again after it has been broken in a bit. You can not really do this in the rollers so any adjustments should be in loose rollers or apart to this stage. This part can be tricky for some, take your time. Small adjustments. TIPS \u00b6 Lube the lead screw. If you are new to all of this, don\u2019t worry about perfect here yet. Most people never even know or care how perfectly square there machine is. Carving a name into a piece of wood no one would notice if it is a 32 nd of a degree off square. Have some fun learn some things, you can always come back to this later. Using the blue square picture as reference, assuming Tension bolts A and B are all the way loose. Tightening B (the long one) would make the angle smaller as shown on the blue square. If instead you tightened both A bolts a bit the angle should open up. If you run into Z axis perpendicularity issues later on it usually means your C tension bolts are not equal. Tighter on top pushes the rails away from the bolt, as well as the bottoms. A square from the work surface to the Z rails can test this after full assembly.

You might need its included drivers, so it is best to let them install. MAC User? -IT should work as is but here is some info if you find you are having issues you might need to change the firmware baud rate and perhaps a different driver. Firmware \u00b6 If you bought a system from me the firmware is pre-loaded and you do not need to make any changes. Marlin is the firmware currently used and it is pre-flashed on the control board included in the kit ( download the pre-configured files here ). If you are building your own feel free to use any board/firmware you want. Testing \u00b6 Never plug or unplug anything into the control board while there is any power, usb or power plug! It is best to start with Repetier-Host It is an easy program to use (do not use repetier server), just in case here is a basic set up . Move your gantry to the center of your build space and make sure the z axis is roughly centered in its travel. You never know which way it\u2019s going to go! With all the motors plugged in, plug in the USB cable and the power to the control board and hit connect in the upper left corner of repetier, it should take a few seconds and turn green to indicate it is connected. Note If you are using a dual end stop firmware flashed board, you have to have the end stops properly connected first, Info . If you have a series flashed board no end stops are needed. You can now use the control in the manual tab to move the machine. The arrows allow for .1, 1, 10, 50mm movements. Start small 1 mm at a time. The arrows should move it in that direction. X positive (Right arrow) should move Right , X negative should move Left, Y positive (up arrow) is back or away from you , Y negative is towards you. Z positive (Z up arrow) moves the z axis up , meaning the tool away from the work surface. If it doesn\u2019t move as expected hit disconnect, unplug the power and usb, any axis that is moving the wrong way simply flip the plug . If one stepper is moving the wrong way power down and flip it\u2019s plug. Power back up and test again. Control Software \u00b6 Now that your machine can talk to your computer you need to be able to control it. You can either use an lcd screen or control software. For the beginners software is usually easier to learn than the LCD screen. This can move the machine along any of the three axis and can also send gcode generated in any program (estlcam, slic3r, Image2Gcode, Fusion360, etc.). Repetier-Host is an easy program to use, here is a basic set up . You can also use Pronterface, Matter Control, ESTLCAM, or many others. Again for the beginners, start with repetier-host (not server).

Please go to v1engineering.com for the up to date and accurate instructions. at v1engineering.com This is an intermediate walk through on 2.5D routing with ESTLCAM . You should have a firm grasp on the basics before trying this. This is how to manually set up a 2.5D cut, the alternative would be to import an STL file and let ESTLCAM choose the paths. The automatically generated STL paths took 50 minutes to cut and did not pick up the small 4mm hole. The following manual paths took 18 minutes to cut and look fantastic! So I can show some different techniques in this walk though I am using piece of Brazilian Ipe that has an uneven top surface, so no reliable Z origin. I will use the bed as the start position and tell ESTLCAM the work surface is slightly higher than measured on the thickest part of the wood. This will allow me to easily surface the uneven wood and not have to estimate where the origin should be. The tool paths start with importing the DXF file in mm. This file has all the part paths on it but not the depth of cut so we will work though this on step at a time. The tool will be starting off to the left of the actual piece of wood touching the bed so the first step is to move the zero point over about half an inch, to approximate where the tool will start. Just select Zero, Point, and Click where you want the new Zero. These are the dimension I will be using for the depths of cut. The first cutting step will be the basic surfacing of the wood to make sure the top is nice and flush. I don\u2019t have much thickness to spare so for surfacing I am only cutting 1.55mm in to the work surface. Because I am starting from the bed the Z origin will be set at the end when ESTLCAM asks for the part height, that will be the Z zero plane (I will be using 11.5mm). So for this part my Z=0 will be 11.5mm from the bed surface. If you had a nice flat piece of material you can make it easier and just start at the work surface. For the cut I select Inside, pocket , and selected the outer most path, shown in red. Make sure to set the tool path depth and machining order starting at one and increment by at least one. The next cut will be a pocket taking the whole surface down in 2 steps, a rough and finishing pass. For the roughing we can start at 1.55mm from the Z=0 plane since that material is already gone from the previous step and go into the material another 4.85mm as see in the part dimensions. For the roughing pass we will leave an allowance of 0.2mm. This lets us come back round for a second pass and only have to mill of .2mm of wood and this leaves a nice smooth Finished surface. So we use an inside pocket pass with .2mm allowance and then a second just inside cut with 0 allowance since the material has already been removed with the roughing pocket no need to cut all that empty space. Current tool path shown in red. Again, always set the machining order. This new pocket will be the depth at which we start the rest of the cuts (6.4mm) Next will be the 4mm hole. We can use a Helical path and start from 6.4mm deep and go a little into the spoil board, I went an extra .2mm for a cut of 5.3mm Now 3 more inside cuts, rough pockets followed by finishing passes. Now that the inner features have been finished it is time to cut the part from the material, leaving 3 small tabs that can easily but snipped off. For this step will will be using an outside cut, with a .2mm allowance, setting the tabs, starting at the Z=0 plane since the outer edge did not get surfaced and cutting .2mm in to the waste board (11.7mm deep). Then the finishing pass with 0 allowance and matching the tabs previously set. Now save your project in case you need to come back and edit your paths. You can do this by using the select tool and changing the popup box parameters. Then export your CNC program (gcode). I use repetier as my visualizer to make sure the cuts look like they should, but to catch small errors if you are new to this I always suggest cutting into high density foam the first run to test your path. Better to waste some time and foam them stress your machine, break a bit, and waste material with some bad gcode. This leaves me with fairly finished part. I can pop it out and use a razor knife to cut off the tabs. I then hit the edges lightly with some 220 git sand paper and call it a day. Here are the files I used, you will probably need to edit these unless your wood is 11.5mm thick. This is the DXF, My generated gcode, and my estlcam project file.

Please buy a copy if you find this works for you. Step one \u2013 Install Estlcam \u00b6 Install Estlcam. Using the default options in the installer, add Icon to start menu and desktop. The first window that pops up I set the language, change the display units, and set it to show the feed rate in mm/s on the tool popups. After you click okay close Estlcam and restart it to update the settings. Step 2 \u2013 Setup \u00b6 After restarting Estlcam, open the setup tab, these are the settings from the first window plus a few extra. Changing the clearance plane to something a little smaller really speeds up a job since the z axis is the slowest. This is how far above the material it should travel to before it moves. You should change the milling direction depending on what kind of material you are cutting, more on this in another post. Setting the z-axis origin to the top of the material makes it easy to set the home position, along with that is program start \u2013 at origin. Choosing to end the program \u201cabove origin\u201d is safe, \u201cabove last position\u201d is the fastest. The creator of Estlcam recently updated his software for us! In the CNC Program Generation tab, choose Marlin (if you are using my firmware). Important \u2013 Set feed unit to mm/min- (this is what the marlin firmware needs). Change the file extension \u201cgcode\u201d so all the programs recognize it. Next up is the travel feed rates. 2100/60=35mm/s, 480=8mm/s (keep the Z low) I delete all the default tools and use this as a conservative test speed setting for an \u215b\u2033 flat endmill in wood. Do not exceed 8mm/s in the z plunge field unless you know what you are doing and know what firmware limits you have. You are ready to generate some GCode. Step 3 \u2013 2D gcode, Good for pen plotting or 2D milling (cutting things out) \u00b6 Grid Size. DXF files are crazy sizes sometimes so to make sure your DXF is the right size change the grid. Found in View>Grid I set mine to 10mm or 25.4mm=1in. For this 2D or 2.5D work .DXF files are used. You can use any vector program to make them, illustrator, SolidWorks, etc. Get some files from here, (Need a new source, sorry). I used this one in the video , Crown Vector . Open DXF. File>Open \u2013 If your DXF is completely the wrong size try again with different initial units. This is what the crown looks like imported in inches as the initial units. This is whatever units you save your DXF as. Step 4 \u2013 Scale / Re-Zero \u00b6 The crown imported at about 55mm wide I want about 150mm wide. Select>Resize>Drawing Layers , then click on the DXF to select it. I scaled the crown 250x to get it to 150mm (5 \u00be\u2033). Zoom out to see your DXF. Zero>Create arbitrary point , then select outside of the DXF paths. This is how to set your origin (or Home). The little blue plus symbol is what your machine sees as 0,0 (x=0, y=0, generally the lower left corner of your work). When you start your program the machine will work to the right and above where you start it from (represented by the blue plus). Some people like to work from the center for round or oval objects. Step 5 \u2013 Select the tool paths \u00b6 To use the pen you want to drawn on the line so use engrave (tool centered on line), if you were cutting a part you can choose part (tool edge on the outside of line), or cutout (tool edge in inside of line). Click Engrave then just click on each line segment. Step 6 \u2013 Save \u00b6 Export. File>Save CNC Program . Give it a name. You will get a depth popup, for the pen I use 1mm or less, anything else set it to the thickness of your material plus a bit to cut all the way through. You can then preview the path. Step 7 \u2013 Control Software \u00b6 Open repetier-host . load the .gcode (or .nc , .ngc) file you just saved. If you have the bed size adjusted you can get a sense of scale. If you can\u2019t see the lines check the box Print Preview>Show Travel moves. View it from the edge and you can see, that the path is below your z-home, and the movements are above z-home. Don\u2019t pay any attention as to where it is shown on the bed. It will start where ever your head currently is. Step 8 \u00b6 Start. Put the tip of the pen (or tool) a hair above where you want it to start and hit run. It should pick up, move, drop down and go. If it goes down first and doesn\u2019t pick up between moves your z axis is backwards. Flip the plug . Test File \u00b6 Test Crown 12mm/s \u2013 If you are having problems try this one (If you are having download issues -Right click- Save as.). Final \u00b6 This all it takes to plot with a pen or do basic 2D (2.5D) milling, some of the most common things this type of mill is used for. Make sure to adjust your tool and its settings depending on the material in use. Always do a test cut! Here is an old video, the new pen holder has a built in spring so you will get even more consistent results.","title":"EstlCAM Basics"},{"location":"software/estlcam-basics/#estlcam-basics","text":"Warning These documents are not yet the official documents.

These are not assembled by me so a few extra minutes starting from scratch can save a lot of headaches in the end. Start by screwing the base plate to the stepper with the M3x6 screw. I prefer to have the wires oriented up. On the Tension arm add the bearing and broad headed screw. If the bearing does not spin freely, flip it over. One side is slightly offset. Make sure the bearing spins free and smoothly. Some sets include a washer, use it if you have it. Threadlocker is a good idea as well. Add the tension arm and bolt. Make sure the arm swivels smoothly. If the arm binds you can loosen the screw a bit. Thread locker is a good idea here as well. Add the pulley next. Usually the set/grub screws are positioned closer to the motor but not always. Center the teeth on the idler pulley and make certain the pulley does not hit the heat sink that gets installed later. Tighten the set screw on the stepper\u2019s flat spot if it has one, the the second screw. Double check the feed pulley to be sure the teeth are inline with the idler and the pulley does not hit the heat sink. Add the MicroSwiss throat and lock nut. This throat does not contain PTFE so it can handle higher temperatures and should not need any maintenance. To help with heat dissipation the lock nut is positioned on the inside of the bracket. Thread the throat is as far as it can go. Do not let the throat make contact with the idler or pulley. The smaller this gap the better soft and flexible filaments will print and the better the heat will dissipate from the throat when printing PLA slowly. Next up is the tension stack. The bottom screw helps to retain the spring (and is not always necessary). This should be the shorter of the two screws. If this screw is too long the arm will not open enough to insert filament. If that is the case don\u2019t use the screw or find a shorter one. The top screw controls the filament pinch tension, tighter is not better, you want just enough to feed without slipping. Tension stack completed. Start with little to no tension and only increase it if your filament slips. Double check the throat is not hitting the idler or pulley. The cooling stack. the screws may or may not have washers. Position the fan wires appropriately. Tighten with moderate tension. This is where a majority of the unwanted heat gets dissipated so tension is good fro heat transfer but too much will ruin the fan, so balance\u2026 The cooling stack completed. Warning If your heat sink has open fins on the bottom it is best to tape off the bottom vents so the fan does not blow air on your prints only up and out. When installing the heat block position the set screw facing down so you can change the heater without a complete tear down if necessary. Add the heater cartridge and guide the thermistor into the small hole. Ensure it is fully inserted. Gently snug the heater cartridge set screw, careful not to damage the heater. Make sure not to move the fragile wires excessively and ensure they are not twisted and sorting out. The nozzle is what locks the block in place. Make sure the nozzle is not locking onto the block but is instead making tight contact with the throat. Warning After the assembly is complete heat up the extrude to a few degrees above your intended use temp and snug up the nozzle before running any filament through. Secure the wires to the top fan hole, and your done with assembly. Plug it in \u00b6 More detail here. You will need power to both sides of the green plug, you can just add a short jumper wire from one side to the other. The polarity is marked on the board, double check to make sure this is correct. The fan on the heat sink needs to always run, this gets plugged directly into the green power plug, polarity matters. Extruder to port D8, polarity does not matter. Optional print fan plugs in to port D9 polarity matters. Marlin edits \u00b6 Very few edits required. Any firmware I release after this post will most likely already be set for this extruder by default. I will put the info here for you adventurous types. Pre-set Firmware All of these that I have gotten have used the marlin #11 thermistor, and at 32 nd stepping I use 200 steps for the e value. #define TEMP_SENSOR_0 11 and #define DEFAULT_AXIS_STEPS_PER_UNIT {200,200,4535.44,200} Even after running the PID auto tune I get a huge overshoot in temp so limiting the max current might help with this, I will update it when I get a chance to test it. // Comment the following line to disable PID and enable bang-bang. #define PIDTEMP #define BANG_MAX 255 // limits current to nozzle while in bang-bang mode; 255=full current #define PID_MAX BANG_MAX // limits current to nozzle while PID is active (see PID_FUNCTIONAL_RANGE below); 255=full current #ifdef PIDTEMP Slicer edits \u00b6 Delete the beginning gcode, you don\u2019t want it to home.

Please go to v1engineering.com for the up to date and accurate instructions. at v1engineering.com Laser Engraving Mirrors \u00b6 Original by Jason | Nov 17, 2016 | Hardware & Electronics, Software Choosing an Image \u00b6 Grey scale images do not translate well on to mirrors because either the surface is reflective or it is not. So straight 2 color images with no gradients are best. Just plain old black and white. The higher the resolution the sharper the edges. Resize and adjust \u00b6 Next is open the image in Photoshop (or any image editor Paint.net is a free alternative), then resize it match the size you need. It is best to set the pixel resolution in your image editor as well. I use 100 px/cm or 0.1mm. I find the best quality with my setup at that resolution. Typically, a higher resolution is recommended but I had unsatisfactory results. While in your editor you can also adjust your levels to make the whites as white as possible and the blacks as black as possible. Image2GCode \u00b6 After you have your image sized and ready to go open up Image2GCode and load your image. The linked version has been modified for the Mostly Printed CNC. Remember you are engraving the backside of the mirror so you have to flip your image horizontally so it appears the correct way on the front of the mirror. If you do not, it will be backwards and you will need to start over. You can also Turn the gamma way down too this will help darken the blacks more if need be. You want the laser blasting as strongly as possible on the mirror. Next on the Laser profile tab you want to leave Min Power at 0 and change Max Power to 255 or select the Max radio button. No other changes required to the defaults here. On the last and final GCODE tab there are a few changes I make here. In the Gcode header section I add the following code: G0 X0 Y0 M201 X1000 Y1000 M204 P1000 T1000 This code turns up the default MPCNC acceleration. You may need to tweak these settings for your machine, these work well for mine. Your feedrate may vary slightly depending on the finish of the mirror. A good starting point would be 1200 mm/min. Click the Use S Param radio button. Type 106 S in the Laser Power on MCODE box and type M107 in the Laser Power Off MCODE box. I like to use diagonal scanning for best quality. You can choose to engrave an edge line if you like or not by selecting the check box. Click Generate file, give your file a name and the GCODE will be output. G Code Sender \u00b6 Before running your file you should have already focused your laser to the height of the mirror surface. Now you can either load the G code onto an SD card and run it from your lcd or open Repetier Host. In repetier click -File, -Load then find your file. Setting your laser to the 0,0 point on your mirror and click print. Several hours later you should end up with something that resembles your file like this. (Sorry I did not have a picture handy of the exact file I used in this example.) Feel free to ask questions here .

If you do not, it will be backwards and you will need to start over. You can also Turn the gamma way down too this will help darken the blacks more if need be. You want the laser blasting as strongly as possible on the mirror. Next on the Laser profile tab you want to leave Min Power at 0 and change Max Power to 255 or select the Max radio button. No other changes required to the defaults here. On the last and final GCODE tab there are a few changes I make here. In the Gcode header section I add the following code: G0 X0 Y0 M201 X1000 Y1000 M204 P1000 T1000 This code turns up the default MPCNC acceleration. You may need to tweak these settings for your machine, these work well for mine. Your feedrate may vary slightly depending on the finish of the mirror. A good starting point would be 1200 mm/min. Click the Use S Param radio button. Type 106 S in the Laser Power on MCODE box and type M107 in the Laser Power Off MCODE box. I like to use diagonal scanning for best quality. You can choose to engrave an edge line if you like or not by selecting the check box. Click Generate file, give your file a name and the GCODE will be output.","title":"Image2GCode"},{"location":"tools/laser-engraving-mirrors/#g-code-sender","text":"Before running your file you should have already focused your laser to the height of the mirror surface.

Please go to v1engineering.com for the up to date and accurate instructions. at v1engineering.com Safety \u00b6 Eyes \u00b6 First and foremost, these really are dangerous, not like ripping the tag off your mattress. These can and will blind and or burn you in less than 1/100 th of a second, It takes ten times that long to even react by blinking if it is in the visible spectrum. Did I make my point yet? Safety glasses are paramount. This is not the place to try and save money. You need a high quality pair and anyone else that could be around it needs the same quality. The cheaper your laser is the more money you will need to spend on the safety glasses. Import lasers are notorious for being dirty, mislabeled, and this makes them more dangerous. High quality lasers are of a known wavelength and strength therefore they are easy to protect yourself from, imports can contain other wavelengths that your goggles may or may not protect you from or be more powerful than your glasses are rated for. I am no expert, have no way of testing, and therefore no real say in who makes quality glasses, I can not make a recommendation at this time. This video might help drive home the point. While we are on the subject, the laser looks extremely harmless in the goggles, kids (and most adults) will try to take off the glasses immediately so no youngsters (or tough guys) unless the laser is fully enclosed behind a laser shield and you trust them to listen. In the glasses the laser is just a bright dot but you can see in your periphery the entire room lights up. You never know when the laser could hit something slightly reflective, your mount could fail, the gcode could cram it into the surface and break your mount, your air assist could drop into and reflect the beam sending send a death beam in any direction. Lungs & Skin \u00b6 The other end of the safety spectrum is the material you are working with. You can\u2019t just go etching and cutting things willy nilly. Ever think you could make chlorine gas or cyanide in your own house\u2026.now you can. Laser cutting vinyl or ABS plastic does just that. Two extremely common materials. Here is the list I refer to most often, if you have a link to a better guide please let me know. Best practice is to contain all the laser smoke and direct it through a filter and vent it outside, at the very least vent it outside. You do not want to breath any of the smoke any modern man made material makes. Fire \u00b6 Now this one might be a little bit of a surprise to some and obvious to others. Lasers are burning your material, add air assist directly to the burn zone and strong ventilation fans and you end up with the best recipe for fire ever. Pay close attention never leave it unattended and have the appropriate type of fire suppression on hand. Fire is not extremely common on good cuts but if it does happen it happens stupid fast with all that force fed oxygen. Basics \u00b6 Types \u00b6 Two of the most common lasers in the maker world are CO2 and Diode lasers. Diode lasers are much more compact, have self contained interchangeable optics, and are an order of magnitude lower power than a typical CO2 laser. More on the Power in a bit. These lasers operate at different wavelengths and this can have an effect of the type of material they are suitable for. Diode based lasers can range in price from a few dollars up to a few hundred, and CO2 based lasers start at a few hundred and go up from there. Both lasers have some sort of focal lens but a CO2 laser also has a mirror system to steer the beam before focus. Diodes can be cooled with a small fan, CO2 use water and sometimes a chiller. Typically on any of the V1 Engineering machines you would be using a diode based laser. If your goal is to cut wood or plastic you should be looking at a CO2 laser. A Diode is best at marking/etching, and is only capable of cutting light materials (foam, paper, plastic) and very thin wood. Power \u00b6 Laser power, not as straight forward as you would think. Higher numbers in general mean thicker materials can be cut or etching can be done faster. Numbers are not everything! A laser has four things to consider when talking about it\u2019s power; wattage, spot size, focal length, spectrum. Wattage \u2013 the overall power output of your laser (like a light bulb, energy per time). On most non-laser specific machines we are limited by speed. Okay stick with me, just like strapping on a chainsaw motor to the MPCNC stronger is not always better. Since we can only move so fast before we start to get motion degradation you need to size your laser accordingly. A strong laser moving slowly will have an extremely limited range of grey levels. For example at the same speed a higher powered laser will have to use power 1-20 so you don\u2019t start a fire (19 levels of grey), but a lower powered laser will be able to use power 1-255 (254 levels of grey) without starting a fire. Make sense? Spot size \u2013 How small of a spot the wattage is concentrated on. Spot size dictates the resolution of the image you can produce, think printer DPI (dots per inch). Another side effect of spot size can be ability to cut. A poorly focused laser\u2019s power is too spread out to be effective, a finely focused laser cuts significantly better. For a diode this can vary 100-400 micron in diameter just by laser wattage. To be more clear, more powerful diode lasers can not be focused to as small of a point as lower powered lasers (the source is not truly a point, larger diodes equal larger initial \u201cpoints\u201d, and it is not actually a spot but a rectangular spot). Focal length \u2013 This influences the shape of the laser cone (long and narrow or short and fat). The focal length is dependent on the lens you use and should be a small range depending on the lens. If you have a choice, a longer focal length can aid in cutting ability (a thinner steeper beam/cone can cut deeper before power is lost to the edges of the material). Spectrum \u2013 The wavelength of the light it produces (diodes-UV to viable, CO2- mid-infrared). Materials react differently to every spectrum as do safety glasses. If you have a specific need do your research before buying. Duty cycle \u2013 One more thing on the topic of power, duty cycle or continuous time on. On the cheap import look out for sensational things like \u201c15W $50!\u201d somewhere in the description it could say \u201cOne second continuous operation time\u201d. This means they are over driving the heck out of the laser, it will not last long, and at 1 second bursts it is not very useful. Guard your wallet from these Scammy Chumps. I just found another ad that says no more than 30min continuous, that might sound like a lot at first but you can do some really detailed things that take a few hours. Air Assist \u00b6 To get cleaner etching, deeper cuts, and to save your lens you need some sort of air assist. While using your laser your material will produce smoke. This smoke if not directed away will stick to the material you are working with producing a sooty poor looking cut or etching. This smoke will also stick to the laser\u2019s lens and very quickly build up heat before you know it the lens will break. Bare minimum you need to have a 40mm fan clearing the area, even better are radial fans (higher pressure more direct), or even better yet a small compressor . If you have the ability to hook up your compressor and aim the air stream you can get significantly better cuts this way. Once again don\u2019t forget to vent your fumes safely and accordingly. The Hard Part \u00b6 Choosing \u00b6 Choosing which laser to buy can be the hardest part. If this all already seems overwhelming just buy a JTechPhotonics kit . Why; it is a trusted laser/company, glasses proven suitable for it, complete kits available, the only kit that is US legal , and the connections and use are as simple as it gets (more later). I think the 2W kits are a great deal. If you have other companies to suggest please let me know, and I will check them out. PWM, TTL, WTF? \u00b6 PWM, and TTL in this context are just how the power of the laser is controlled. All we really care about is if the laser is controlled by 5V or 12V. Good brands and companies make this abundantly clear, if you are buying an import this is by far the hardest part of the whole thing. The specs are not clear, the wiring diagrams are typically non-existent and if they are they can be wrong, we even have drivers with PCB\u2019s with misprinted polarity so you can\u2019t even follow that. Unfortunately import lasers, while super cheap, tend to be a guess and check game, both with connections and lens specs. With all common boards we can handle 12V and 5V signals, no big deal! 12V signal driven lasers are less common (Jtech). They are simple, you plug them into the print fan port (or any 12V port) on your control board and you are good to go. Using a 12V port you will typically use M106 SXXX to turn the laser on and M107 to turn the laser off. The Sxxx is the laser strength with a value between 0-255, 255 being the most power. 5V driven lasers need a firmware edit to assign the right pin for your board, this just reassigns the 12v fan pin to instead control a 5V pin. After that the same rules apply, use M106 SXXX to turn the laser on and M107 to turn the laser off. The Sxxx is the laser strength with a value between 0-255, 255 being the most power.
