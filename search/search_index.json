Since day one I have never encouraged endstops be used, until now. The Mostly Printed CNC and LowRider CNC are unique in the fact that two of the axes are powered at each end of the axis. Using this fact and the new dual endstop firmware we can now more precisely and accurately set the position of every single stepper on the machine independently. This should reliably give you repeat-ability on the order of your endstops resolution, even after powering off. Before this new firmware update all the machines in this category relied 100% on the users build accuracy, or manual measuring. This involves setting of each axis before engaging the steppers and locking it in place. If the steppers are ever disengaged during use only the side of the axis with an endstop can accurately be accounted for. This makes fixturing, tool changes, and multi-day jobs extremely difficult to get repeatable results. A poor build or lack of axis alignment before each job will result in a non square skewed axis. A skewed axis will result in ovals and parallelograms instead of circles and 90\u00b0 cornered rectangles. Changes in build accuracy due to use and environmental conditions need to be adjusted out or accounted for manually. Now just a minor offset adjustment will correct this. Plugging In The Steppers \u00b6 Remapping of pins is used in the firmware to allow the use of all the control boards drivers. The unused extruder driver/s are used for the extra stepper/s. Ramps \u00b6 Mini-RAMBo \u00b6 This board only has 4 drivers available and can easily be used with the LowRider CNC but can not full take advantage of the new firmware with the MPCNC. Archim \u00b6 RAMBo \u00b6 Endstops \u00b6 The min pins are used as normal for the first stepper and the max pins are used for the second stepper on that axis, still as a min. For example, X1 pairs with Xmin, X2 pairs with Xmax. DO NOT USE THE + (positive) Terminal. S & \u2013 (signal and Negative) Only Xmin=X1 limit switch Xmax=X2 limit switch Ymin=Y1 limit Switch Ymax=Y2 Limit switch Zmin=Touch probe. Signal pin to plate, negative to tool. For the safest configuration the endstops should be wired in the Normally Closed position (NC), to prevent wire disconnects from damaging the machine during the homing sequence. Mechanical endstops are connected to the signal and ground pins filtered or optical endstops use all three pins, connect these with extreme caution. Using the wrongs pins will damage your control board. Optical endstops are not recommended on a machine used for milling or routing. The debris can inhibit there function. I made modified a few parts to keep the wiring clean, Clean Dual Mounts . Mini-RAMBo \u00b6 This board only has 4 drivers available and can easily be used with the LowRider CNC (Y axis) but can not full take advantage of the new firmware with the MPCNC. RAMBo \u00b6 Pay attention the pins are opposite each other, but clearly labeled on the board. Archim \u00b6 Ramps \u00b6 Firmware \u00b6 The dual endstop firmware is on the V1 Engineering Marlin GitHub page. Remember small 1mm moves when initially powering it up, if driving your steppers the wrong way you can rip your machine apart. If your steppers are moving the wrong direction, completely power off your board before flipping the plug over. In case you have never used GitHub, the first drop down lets you select the firmware version you want. The next step is download the firmware you selected. Click on \u201cClone or Download\u201d, then click on \u201cDownload Zip\u201d. Testing and Calibration \u00b6 After all the endstops have been connected issuing a M119 command will let you see the current status of each endstop. You should check that each endstop registers both an open and closed status before proceeding. Open when not touching and closed when they are. You can test them individually by closing each one by hand and running an M119 . Also verify the X1 corresponds to the X1 stepper. Then verify a positive movement is away from the end stops. The unfortunately designated M666 lets you test your offset to quickly calibrate your machine. Using the command M666 X0.72 would offset the X1 stepper 0.72mm away from it\u2019s endstop, Y! can also be used. To verify your current settings during calibration just an M666 will show the current offsets. Once the correct offset are found you should input them into your firmware. This is to simplify the actual placement of the endstops themselves, you only need to get them such that the X1 or Y1 endstop is at or slightly behind where it needs to be within a few Millimeters is best. You can verify how square your axis is by measuring the diagonals of the largest rectangle you can draw in your build area. The larger the more accurate\u2026but also harder to measure. I only have 6\u2033 calipers but I was more accurate with a tape measure at my 440mm available diagonal. Measure the diagonals to the X1 and Y1 endstops blocks. Offset the endstop that has the short dimension by the amount it is short or just a hair over. So if the X1 diagonal was 1mm short you would offset X1 by 1mm. M666 X1. Tip \u2013 If it is more than 2mm off move the stop block, each belt tooth is 2mm. Draw a fresh one to verify. If that is correct you should edit your firmware to make this change permanent in configuration.h Or add it to all of your Gcode. Enjoy! Care should be taken to use as little pen pressure as possible with the finest tip possible to get the most accurate results and a pen mount with some give should be used, example pen mount . My trials and tribulations figuring this out\u2026.Feel free to make fun of me. Forum link . Use \u00b6 First, most jobs will not benefit from using endstops. Getting the machine close and just running a quick one off carving or sign has no need to go through all the extra steps. People new to the CNC world should not use this, this is a advanced technique. My support for this will be limited. You can now use the machine in two ways. Quick one off jobs as you always would setting the home position by hand and just running the job. Or by starting each job with a G28 (if using a touch plate) you can now reference or return to that position at any time. If you are not using a touch plate you can use G28 X Y You can use fixtures at a set reference points on the table to do repeat jobs or multiple sided cuts utilizing CAM based work offsets or scripts. Tool changes can be done with multiple gcodes so you can do repeat jobs in order of bit used instead of per piece depending on if changing the part of the bit is the faster choice. Jobs can be restarted in case of power outage, tool breaks, long multi day jobs, apply paint between cuts, etc. If you don\u2019t need the endstops you can just insert the command, G92 X0 Y0 Z0 , in your gcode before the cut starts. This should allow for normal use without homing or work offsets, also no squaring. For more info please see the Milling Basics page. Work offsets \u00b6 Make sure your job has a work offset if you use the endstops. A typical part has the gcode built with the origin at the parts corner. If you where to cut out that part it would result in going negative past your endstops and misalign your machine. Negative moves do not work on the X and Y axis with endstops. Moving the origin in your CAM program is the easiest fix. To get a more precise work offset it is best to add it in your CAD file. This can be done with a bounding box, cut it as a separate path and used to position your material. How it is done in the firmware \u00b6 Marlin currently has to have at least one extruder defined, this extruder causes us an issue has we need the driver it is assigned to. All boards have and E0 driver (some call it something different), and dual firmware capable boards also have an E1 driver, beyond that most boards have breakout pins for more external drivers. The first extruder gets assigned to driver E0. To make this all work I change pin assignments for E0 to one of the external break pins change the current E1 pins to the E0 driver, and create an E2 set and assign them the pins of the E1 driver. I hope that makes sense, I move E0 pin assingments out of the way and shuffle E1 and E2 down one slot. All of this happens in the Pins/Pins_XXXX.h files. XXXX=whatever board you are using.","title":"Dual Endstops"},{"location":"electronics/dual-endstops/#auto-square-dual-endstops","text":"","title":"Auto Square, Dual EndStops"},{"location":"electronics/dual-endstops/#basics","text":"The Dual EndStop firmware update enables unprecedented precision more easily than ever before.

You should check that each endstop registers both an open and closed status before proceeding. Open when not touching and closed when they are. You can test them individually by closing each one by hand and running an M119 . Also verify the X1 corresponds to the X1 stepper. Then verify a positive movement is away from the end stops. The unfortunately designated M666 lets you test your offset to quickly calibrate your machine. Using the command M666 X0.72 would offset the X1 stepper 0.72mm away from it\u2019s endstop, Y! can also be used. To verify your current settings during calibration just an M666 will show the current offsets. Once the correct offset are found you should input them into your firmware. This is to simplify the actual placement of the endstops themselves, you only need to get them such that the X1 or Y1 endstop is at or slightly behind where it needs to be within a few Millimeters is best. You can verify how square your axis is by measuring the diagonals of the largest rectangle you can draw in your build area. The larger the more accurate\u2026but also harder to measure. I only have 6\u2033 calipers but I was more accurate with a tape measure at my 440mm available diagonal. Measure the diagonals to the X1 and Y1 endstops blocks. Offset the endstop that has the short dimension by the amount it is short or just a hair over. So if the X1 diagonal was 1mm short you would offset X1 by 1mm. M666 X1. Tip \u2013 If it is more than 2mm off move the stop block, each belt tooth is 2mm. Draw a fresh one to verify. If that is correct you should edit your firmware to make this change permanent in configuration.h Or add it to all of your Gcode. Enjoy! Care should be taken to use as little pen pressure as possible with the finest tip possible to get the most accurate results and a pen mount with some give should be used, example pen mount .

Getting the machine close and just running a quick one off carving or sign has no need to go through all the extra steps. People new to the CNC world should not use this, this is a advanced technique. My support for this will be limited. You can now use the machine in two ways. Quick one off jobs as you always would setting the home position by hand and just running the job. Or by starting each job with a G28 (if using a touch plate) you can now reference or return to that position at any time. If you are not using a touch plate you can use G28 X Y You can use fixtures at a set reference points on the table to do repeat jobs or multiple sided cuts utilizing CAM based work offsets or scripts. Tool changes can be done with multiple gcodes so you can do repeat jobs in order of bit used instead of per piece depending on if changing the part of the bit is the faster choice. Jobs can be restarted in case of power outage, tool breaks, long multi day jobs, apply paint between cuts, etc. If you don\u2019t need the endstops you can just insert the command, G92 X0 Y0 Z0 , in your gcode before the cut starts. This should allow for normal use without homing or work offsets, also no squaring.

A typical part has the gcode built with the origin at the parts corner. If you where to cut out that part it would result in going negative past your endstops and misalign your machine. Negative moves do not work on the X and Y axis with endstops. Moving the origin in your CAM program is the easiest fix. To get a more precise work offset it is best to add it in your CAD file. This can be done with a bounding box, cut it as a separate path and used to position your material.","title":"Work offsets"},{"location":"electronics/dual-endstops/#how-it-is-done-in-the-firmware","text":"Marlin currently has to have at least one extruder defined, this extruder causes us an issue has we need the driver it is assigned to.

The first extruder gets assigned to driver E0. To make this all work I change pin assignments for E0 to one of the external break pins change the current E1 pins to the E0 driver, and create an E2 set and assign them the pins of the E1 driver.

Width (X direction on rails) should always be the shorter axis and is recommended to keep the work area no larger than 4\u2032 on this axis. The Z direction (height) is best kept to a 3-4\u2033 maximum for wood, with that being said, you can make the usable z length as much as you want you will be working from the bottom up, so go to town. Calculator for table, rail, and belt lengths in inches. Calculator for table, rail, and belt lengths in Millimeters. Version 1 Version one instructions are here Assembly \u00b6 All quantities shown in the drawings are for each assembly, not total quantities. Center Assembly \u00b6 The VacDuct, sits inside the router clamp body to separate the router exhaust and the vacuum intake. When setting the tension for the X Mounts after attaching them to the plate set the tension for each mount individually. An easy way is to use the Z rail and run it through each one, very light tension, you might not even need to add any, the mounts are interference fit. When fully assembled the XZ main\u2019s should sit completely flat on the YZ rollers. If not check these three points. Double check that the Z rails are parallel, same distance apart at the bottom as they are on the top. If you loosen the corner brackets up too much and the XZ mains still won\u2019t sit flat the larger bolts are not tensioned properly / evenly (probably way way too much). Make sure all four notches are above the end of the Z rails. The XZ & XZ_side should be installed with an equal gap on all four screws. There should be a gap of a few millimeters equally on each side of the corners to the XZ Main. These parts can alter the Z rail angles so care is needed. They do not need to be extremely tight, a little pressure goes a long way. This is how these couplers should be used. The coupler should not be compressed, if anything a little stretch to make sure the lead screw is in contact with the stepper shaft. This prevents bouncing. The lead screw should be only inserted as far as the coupler bottom collar. This lets the stepper shaft and lead screw to move for any minor misalignment. Seat the grub screws on the shaft trying to get the straightest connection possible. If you hit an edge it will get wonky just give it a little turn and try again. On the stepper shaft tighten the flat screw first then the one that hits the round surface. Do not forget to lube the Z lead screws. There is a small notch / ridge to prevent the Z rails from coming out of the top on all 4 parts. If your rails are crooked this is where to check. Sides \u00b6 It is best not to tighten the M3 screws all the way on the T8 nuts. This allows for a touch of misalignment and smoother Z action. Don\u2019t worry their only job it to stop rotation, gravity does the rest. Belts \u00b6 Belt Insert \u00b6 Why? The cable_tie_insert was made to eliminate the flex and bounce of the cable tie and belt connection. This will help keep a reasonable arc in the cable tie at the belt end provided you use the clasp end as shown and the belt flat. This should eliminate cable tie/belt flex on a properly tensioned belt and the tension should stay true longer. The other end of the cable tie connection is rounded internally on all printed parts with a similar arc. Using a few segments of the belt itself when securing the end ensures a better connection on the belts teeth. 3-4 teeth facing teeth up will make for a more round surface of the cable tie that secures the folded belt. This will prevent a wide belt from cupping and slipping teeth. Belt Ends \u00b6 Table \u00b6 Use the dimensions from the calculator, make it as flat and square as you can. The edges guide the machine so those are important. I used some 2\u2033x3\u2033 and \u00bd\u2033 particle board on top. The X direction is more important to get flat than the Y direction, so build accordingly. Usually this means solid supports in The X direction. If you can picture it the machine and material can follow a subtle curve down the length much more so than the width. Note Ideal table thickness is 4\u2033 or less. Firmware \u00b6 The standard MPCNC firmware will work with any board on the LowRider2. Dual endstop firmware is not really needed since all three axis have hard stops you can use for alignment. Firmware page. For the creative of you, you could use the dual end stop firmware for Y alignment or even Z (homing min or max). Hose Channel \u00b6 I use 1.5\u2033-2\u2033 aluminum angle with a few Velcro straps to keep the hose and cords contained. Bigger or smaller works depending on the hose size you use. Getting Started \u00b6 Using the machine. \u00b6 1) Square it up. After mounting your work piece (making sure the mounting hardware is not going to interfere) I check to make sure the sides (Assemblies with the wheels on them) are the same distance from the nearest end. You can do this by making sure the wheels are hitting the stop blocks/belt mounts. 2) Double check. You only need to do this the first few times until you understand the machine. Use the LCD to control the machine. Lift the gantry high enough as to not drag the bit across your material. Drive the machine the entire length of what you will be cutting. This is to make sure the machine does not hit the table and you are parallel with it. Another way to do this is include an outline in your design and use it as your fist tool path above your material. This is to make sure nothing binds or hits. 3) Set your starting position. Use the lcd to position the bit at your zero position in all three axis. 4) Beginning gcode. If you use the Fusion 360 post processor this is done for you but make sure your beginning gcode resets all your axis to 0,0,0 , you can use this command, G92 X0 Y0 Z0 . 5) Ending gcode. What should happen is your job ends above your last position, meaning your bit should not drag across the surface if you move it. With the bit above the last position, telling the machine to go back to the starting position will return the machine to where you started it and then making sure the steppers do not turn off is a good idea as the LowRider will drop under it\u2019s own weight. The last few lines of your gcode should look like this. G1 Z7 F400 (this is my clearance plane and is already in my gcode) G1 X0 Y0 F2100 (I add this to have the machine drive its self back to the start) At this point you can use the lcd to move the machine clear of your material and lower it, then power off. Or, if you leave a little room you can drive past your starting point and lower automatically. G1 Z7 F400 (already there) G1 X-15 Y-15 F2100 (drive 15mm past your start) G1 Z0 F400 (Lower the machine) M84; Turn steppers off","title":"Assembly"},{"location":"lowrider/#low-rider-cnc-2","text":"The LowRider2 CNC is my revised version of a CNC router that can handle full sheet material!

After mounting your work piece (making sure the mounting hardware is not going to interfere) I check to make sure the sides (Assemblies with the wheels on them) are the same distance from the nearest end. You can do this by making sure the wheels are hitting the stop blocks/belt mounts. 2) Double check. You only need to do this the first few times until you understand the machine. Use the LCD to control the machine. Lift the gantry high enough as to not drag the bit across your material. Drive the machine the entire length of what you will be cutting. This is to make sure the machine does not hit the table and you are parallel with it. Another way to do this is include an outline in your design and use it as your fist tool path above your material. This is to make sure nothing binds or hits. 3) Set your starting position. Use the lcd to position the bit at your zero position in all three axis. 4) Beginning gcode. If you use the Fusion 360 post processor this is done for you but make sure your beginning gcode resets all your axis to 0,0,0 , you can use this command, G92 X0 Y0 Z0 . 5) Ending gcode. What should happen is your job ends above your last position, meaning your bit should not drag across the surface if you move it. With the bit above the last position, telling the machine to go back to the starting position will return the machine to where you started it and then making sure the steppers do not turn off is a good idea as the LowRider will drop under it\u2019s own weight. The last few lines of your gcode should look like this. G1 Z7 F400 (this is my clearance plane and is already in my gcode) G1 X0 Y0 F2100 (I add this to have the machine drive its self back to the start) At this point you can use the lcd to move the machine clear of your material and lower it, then power off. Or, if you leave a little room you can drive past your starting point and lower automatically.

The V2 has tightened up some of the designs from my first version, every single part is different. Nothing too major. Better belt placement, better frame geometry, more robust parts, better extruder mount, easier to set home stops, slightly larger build volume, ability to use thicker material for the frame, optional bottom plate for rigidity, better smooth rod handling. This page \u00b6 If you just want to open a box and have a ready 3D printer there are a few solid options out there. The MP3DP V2 is a printer for those of you that want to build one, get your hands dirty, and learn a thing or two! Currently this is just a guide, not a full set of instructions. If anything is unclear let us know and we can add a picture or two. Hopefully nothing is to tricky here. Github Questions comment \u2013 HERE . Version 1 Version one instructions are here Flat Parts \u00b6 The frame components were designed for \u215c\u2033 material this time, the bed support is still good for \u00bc\u2033 (the lighter the better for the bed). All the parts can safely go above a little thicker than \u00bd\u2033 and as thin as you want for those of you with access to high tech materials. Material thickness will determine some screw lengths as outlined below. I have included a \u201cY Speed Plate\u201d for the ultimate bed support. I use insulation under my bed so I also included a full \u201cY Plate\u201d, also needed for you savages that use 4 corner heated bed mounting. Make sure only to cut the one you need as you do not need both. All inside corners were designed with \u215b\u2033 diameter or smaller end mills.

Pass through the block and tension the other parts. Make sure the ends clear and do not hit the pulley or idler. Better alignment? GT2 Idlers \u00b6 I took a while to release these parts because my idlers kept seizing up. I have two suggestions, first lube them well, I am using the super lube from the shop, no issues since. Second belt tension does not have to be super human here. Start loose and only tighten the belts if you notice issues. Too tight=excessive ringing and premature idler damage, Too loose=soft rounded corners and poor wall consistancy. X Axis \u00b6 Easy adjust, more consistent belt tension. Use the screws to set the smooth rods into place, or use super glue like before. They should be adjusted top an bottom to, 301mm. you can measure this top and bottom to ensure the ends are parallel. Wires \u00b6 If you need a good first printing project how about a box to hide those wires, Gnarly Mini-Rambo Case , or a case for the LCD ? Extruders \u00b6 I have designed this with both the Titan Aero , and the MK8 in mind they both work great choice is yours. The mounting plate is pretty straight forward the holes are easy enough to utilize for anything you might need if you don\u2019t like either of those. The holes are 64mm apart. Printed Parts \u00b6 Infill on the parts is not a big deal I use 15%-20%, but make sure to use 2-3 perimeter walls to keep the through hole support.

Hardware \u00b6 Here is a simplified hardware list, a few parts are made for shorter hardware but this is as simple as it gets. You can also go longer on most all of these. M3.5mm is almost a direct fit for the #6-32 screws, some seem not to want to order these online if they can\u2019t find them locally so an M4 will probably work. I really suggest just ordering a box of M3.5\u2019s for simplicity. Qty Name Comment 3 #6-32 x 1.5\u2033 Hex heads. These are for the XYZ endstop adjustments. 60 #6-32 x ??(1\u2033) Frame screw length depends on frame material thickness, round up in length. See Below. 55 #6-32 Nylocs 20 M3 x 10mm Stepper and T8 nut screws 5 M3 x 22mm Bed adjustment and Idler screws 4 M3 Nylocs 3 Control Board screws mount screws,standoffs dependent on your board. e.g. (M3x22mm with 10mm rubber standoffs) 3 Power supply screws mount screws,standoffs dependent on your power supply. e.g.(M5 x 20mm 7mm rubber standoffs) The control board and power supply screws will depend on your hardware, frame thickness and preferred stand off distance, easy thing to do is cut rubber hose as the standoffs. Screw length \u00b6 This is the hard part. A \u00be\u2033 screw is a thread or two away from fitting a \u215c\u2033 frame board, counter sinking would make them fit. I chose to use 1\u2033 instead. you need .423\u2033 (that is the printed part and nut thickness) plus the thickness of your frame / bed material, minimum. Longer should not be an issue. Bed bearings \u00b6 Trying out a new style here, one side is shorter to allow for clamping if necessary. I found it usually is not, If you over tighten it you can actually crush the bearings and damage them. Default to super loose or no clamp screw/nut at all. Just a screw on the flush side should be enough. EndStops \u00b6 The endstops should be wired Normally Closed, NC, for safety. Initial leveling \u00b6 Rough When setting up your printer first level your X axis. Measure from the top of the motor mounts to the bottom of the vertical bearing blocks. The next thing is to level the bed. This is done by setting the 2 screws on the right side (front and back) to the nozzle height, then set the single screw on the left of the bed. Home Set each of the three endstop trigger screws such that the nozzle comes to rest just touching the print surface in the nearest left corner. Final and tune up Heat up the system, make sure the X axis is still level with the motor mounts, make sure the bed is still level with the nozzle. Adjust Z home trigger screw to get the correct first layer. Firmware \u00b6 The beta Marlin 2.0 version is on the github page , or the old MP3DP firmware works (found below as a backup). There are nots on the github version there are two settings that need to be changed for the MK8 or the Titan Aero, the thermistor value 11 for the MK8 or 5 for the Aero, and 100 steps for the E on the MK8. Slicer and MK8 \u00b6 If you need some initial settings to get started there are slicer settings at the end of this page , and a breakdown of an MK8 assembly.","title":"Main"},{"location":"mp3dp/#mp3dp-v2-","text":"This is my take on a Prusa I3, with a CNC mill friendly frame.

I would like to drive that price home one more time, you can have a CNC router for precision work ( here , here all the way up to aluminum milling and plasma cutting steel for $486. That is all you need to spend, throw in a few endmills and you are still under $500. There is no other machine more versatile than the Mostly Printed CNC at any price point. Specs\u2026 \u00b6 Not easy to make a specs page when it can have most any specs you want. The idea behind this is to be extremely adaptable and inexpensive. Why buy a single use machine when you can have one that does it all for less than the cost of any single function machine. No proprietary hardware or software, build it any size and shape you want (more on this later), buy it from this site or source it all yourself, helpful forums, low cost, and capable. What more could you ask for? This machine can easily do many things, how about making some coffee with Apach\u2026(not me but I think he is my new hero). Size \u00b6 All axis can be any length you prefer, anything over 3 \u00bd\u2032 (1M) would require small mid-span supports to increase rigidity, of course smaller is better. The kit comes with enough belt for up to 48\u2033 of total outer X and Y axis dimensions (eg 24\u2033x24\u2033, 36\u2033x12\u2033 or any other combination). The smaller you make this the faster you can move it and the more rigid/accurate it will be, and more importantly the easier it will be to get the desired accuracy. The linear motion is ball bearings on electrical conduit (or stainless steel)\u2026 seriously, easy to use and source. More information on this here . If this machine isn\u2019t big enough I have also designed the LowRider CNC , all the same specs and resolution just designed to be bigger! Power \u00b6 X and Y axis are powered by 2 stepper motors each, and a single stepper for the Z axis. The standard would be NEMA 17 in any torque preferably 42 OZ/in and above (the kit come with 76 OZ/in). No need for NEMA 23\u2019s or their required larger drivers, torque is not one of this machines issues. Belts are used for there accuracy and price. Small belts are used because each axis has two of them. Ballscrews are expensive, require tuning, and periodic maintenance / adjustments. Control \u00b6 This is all controlled by any control board you like. The UltiMachine boards are recommended for the improved design and robust safety features. You can still use the common Ramps 1.4 or any others boards as well. There are other Marlin based boards, GRBL , and regular CNC boards as well. Software \u00b6 There are plenty of free or really inexpensive software options available for 3D printing, CAM, and CAD. I suggest Fusion 360 , Repetier-host , ESTLCam , ect. DIY \u00b6 Besides using either common imperial or metric hardware, the rest of the machine is easily 3D printable, RepRap style!

This will get tightened during the final step. Bottom Corner and Lock Corner \u00b6 Bottom_Corner and Lock_Corner parts or BottomM_Corner and LockM_Corner, \u00be\u2033 (M4 X 20) Scew and nut, optional Cyanoacrylate Glue. Use the matching Bottom_Corner and Lock_Corner parts or BottomM_Corner and LockM_Corner parts. The direction of the letter will match when assembled of the correct set. Optional but suggested, add some glue to these parts before screwing together for added rigidity. Put the screw \u00be\u2033 (M4 X 20) in from the corner piece and the nut into the lock, and hold with a socket or pliers. This screw can get snugged down. Leg Assembly \u00b6 \u00be\u2033 (M4 X 20) screw and nut, previous assemblies. Assemble the corners on to the Bottoms, add the screw \u00be\u2033 (M4 X 20) and nut (nut goes in the hex shaped hole). Leave these screws loose, they will get snugged up in the final step. Repeat this for all four sets. Roller Assembly - Fixed Bearings \u00b6 Use the 1.25\u2033 (M8 X 30) bolts, lock nuts, 608 bearings, and the Roller or RollerM. Nuts are best facing towards each other, unless you plan on adding mid span supports then the other way could get you some extra clearance. These can get snugged up, don\u2019t crack the plastic , just snug. Do this for all 4 sets. Roller Assembly - Tension Bolts \u00b6 2.5\u2033 (M8 X 65) bolt, 608 Bearings, Roller or Dual plates. Use the 2.5\u2033 (M8 X 65) bolt, run it through the Roller Plate (or the dual plates ). After the Roller plate add a 608 bearing. Add the plate and bearing stack into the Roller from the single bearing side. Only part way Add a Bearing into the center of the roller, and thread the bolt the rest of the way into the roller. Pay attention to the direction of the plate, the stand offs should face the bearings , and the extra notches should face the single bearing. Rollers on Rails \u00b6 Previous assemblies, 5/16\u201d (M8) Nylock nuts, X or Y rail. The nut for the 2.5\u2033 (M8 X 65) bolt should be left extremely loose almost touching the roller but not all the way. Make sure these nuts don\u2019t interfere with the small nut slots, if they do put the small nuts in now. Put all the rollers on their rails and make sure they all slide equally well. There should be tension when inserting the rail and all the bearings should touch. Roller Matched Pairs \u00b6 This is showing the pairs for the X and Y axis. It should be one Roller and one RollerM. It does not matter which way the gantry rail angle is facing as long as it is facing the same as its counterpart. Roller and RollerM are just a mirrored set, made to help with printer deficiencies. Each axis gets one of each and the need to look mirrored (angle on the same side). When using the optional Dual plates, the long side should face X0 Y0 (nearest left corner) Lower Corner Assembly \u00b6 Previous assemblies, Spacer_corners Add your Y rails and rollers to the corner assemblies (front to back axes). Make sure the angled belt brackets face out, and the angles are pointed towards each other. Lay a Spacer_Corner on the rail. Lay the X rail and rollers on next (Right to left axes). Full Corner Assembly \u00b6 Top_Corner pieces, \u00be\u2033 (M4 X 20) screws, and nuts. Put on the Top_Corner pieces. Make sure the brackets are facing out, and the angles towards each other.

Tension Bolt \u201cB\u201d \u00b6 This step uses the XY, XYZ, Lock Nut, 5\u2033 (M8 x 130) bolt, 2 bearing, both gantry spacers, and a nut. The 5\u2033 (M8 X 130) bolt goes through the XYZ plate. Next is a gantry spacer. Add the XY piece, align it with the hole on the side of the XYZ piece. Insert a bearing into the XY piece. The second XY piece is added to the stack, again lining up the side hole. The second bearing is then added. Add the second Gantry spacer. The second XYZ piece is next, upside down as compared to the first. Like face to like face. Followed by the lock nut. The lock nut should be kept loose , just engage the nylon. This 5\u2033 (130mm) bolt is Tension bolt B. Add in the brass T8 nut and secure with 1 or more M3x10 screw These screws only prevent the nut from turning no need to over tighten or fill all four holes. It is best to actually leave these a little loose to allow the nut to have better alignment with the screw. Seat them all the way and back off a half turn. Tension Bolts C(x4) \u00b6 Use the 4, 2.5\u2033 (M8 x 65) bolts, bearings and lock nuts. These are Tension Bolts C. These should be left extremely loose, just just slightly touching the plastic. Squaring \u00b6 Now that the assembly is complete, this is the best time to double check to make sure the rails are perpendicular. An inexpensive square works just fine. Both of the ones pictured were about $5. Insert all 4 rails into the assembly (X, Y, and The Z assembly). The least amount of tension on the rails is best. At this point, with all the tension bolts loose the rails they should actually be a snug fit, if they are not post some pictures in the forums so we can help. Tension bolts \u201cC\u201d should have the locknuts and the bolt heads tightened so they are just touching the plastic. Equal light tension keeps the Z axis perpendicular to the work surface and locks the assembly together. Use a square to see if your XY rails are, perpendicular. You can tension bolts \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB\u201d to adjust the rail angle. It is best to adjust by loosening them. If they are already loose tightening them slightly moves the rail away from the tension bolt. I\u2019m sorry there is no magic bullet for this part. For most people this should go together square as is, but if you are having issues you might just want to run it as is for a while and then try again after it has been broken in a bit. You can not really do this in the rollers so any adjustments should be in loose rollers or apart to this stage. This part can be tricky for some, take your time. Small adjustments. TIPS \u00b6 Lube the lead screw. If you are new to all of this, don\u2019t worry about perfect here yet. Most people never even know or care how perfectly square there machine is. Carving a name into a piece of wood no one would notice if it is a 32 nd of a degree off square. Have some fun learn some things, you can always come back to this later. Using the blue square picture as reference, assuming Tension bolts A and B are all the way loose. Tightening B (the long one) would make the angle smaller as shown on the blue square. If instead you tightened both A bolts a bit the angle should open up. If you run into Z axis perpendicularity issues later on it usually means your C tension bolts are not equal. Tighter on top pushes the rails away from the bolt, as well as the bottoms. A square from the work surface to the Z rails can test this after full assembly.

It will act as a torque multiplier and completely ruin your accuracy/precision. Anything necessary should be attached to the main gantry assembly there is lots of room on the XYZ piece. The tool mount piece uses either #6 lock nuts or M4. Insert the nuts facing the right direction and if they are not a snug fit a tiny drop of glue in the corner will keep them from falling out. I add one after they are inserted right at the corner of each nut just to be safe. I use cyanoacrylate gel. It is not doing anything other making sure they do not fall out when not in use, if they are in use they do not depend on the glue at all.

This dimension will be different for every build. Check again, are the rails still flat? Add the screws \u00be\u2033 (M4 X 20) and nuts to the Z brackets, snug slightly. Snug slightly means, less than you think . If it is too loose at some point the mounts could move up and is very easily noticed and is easily fixed by going a very tiny bit more snug. If they are too tight you will crack the mount, not easily fixed. Err on the side of too loose. Check again, are the rails still sitting flat? Add the lead screw into the coupler. The lead screw should touch the motor shaft to fight thrust in the other direction from the lower mount bearing. Again, not the best engineering solution but it works great with this light load.

Done with the Z Axis!","title":"Z Axis"},{"location":"software/","text":"Getting Started \u00b6 First Use \u00b6 Install the Arduino software and its drivers before you plug in your control board. You might need its included drivers, so it is best to let them install. MAC User? -IT should work as is but here is some info if you find you are having issues you might need to change the firmware baud rate and perhaps a different driver. Firmware \u00b6 If you bought a system from me the firmware is pre-loaded and you do not need to make any changes. Marlin is the firmware currently used and it is pre-flashed on the control board included in the kit ( download the pre-configured files here ). If you are building your own feel free to use any board/firmware you want. Testing \u00b6 Never plug or unplug anything into the control board while there is any power, usb or power plug! It is best to start with Repetier-Host It is an easy program to use (do not use repetier server), just in case here is a basic set up . Move your gantry to the center of your build space and make sure the z axis is roughly centered in its travel. You never know which way it\u2019s going to go! With all the motors plugged in, plug in the USB cable and the power to the control board and hit connect in the upper left corner of repetier, it should take a few seconds and turn green to indicate it is connected. Note If you are using a dual end stop firmware flashed board, you have to have the end stops properly connected first, Info . If you have a series flashed board no end stops are needed. You can now use the control in the manual tab to move the machine. The arrows allow for .1, 1, 10, 50mm movements. Start small 1 mm at a time. The arrows should move it in that direction. X positive (Right arrow) should move Right , X negative should move Left, Y positive (up arrow) is back or away from you , Y negative is towards you. Z positive (Z up arrow) moves the z axis up , meaning the tool away from the work surface. If it doesn\u2019t move as expected hit disconnect, unplug the power and usb, any axis that is moving the wrong way simply flip the plug . If one stepper is moving the wrong way power down and flip it\u2019s plug. Power back up and test again. Control Software \u00b6 Now that your machine can talk to your computer you need to be able to control it. You can either use an lcd screen or control software. For the beginners software is usually easier to learn than the LCD screen. This can move the machine along any of the three axis and can also send gcode generated in any program (estlcam, slic3r, Image2Gcode, Fusion360, etc.).

You should have a firm grasp on the basics before trying this. This is how to manually set up a 2.5D cut, the alternative would be to import an STL file and let ESTLCAM choose the paths. The automatically generated STL paths took 50 minutes to cut and did not pick up the small 4mm hole. The following manual paths took 18 minutes to cut and look fantastic! So I can show some different techniques in this walk though I am using piece of Brazilian Ipe that has an uneven top surface, so no reliable Z origin. I will use the bed as the start position and tell ESTLCAM the work surface is slightly higher than measured on the thickest part of the wood. This will allow me to easily surface the uneven wood and not have to estimate where the origin should be. The tool paths start with importing the DXF file in mm. This file has all the part paths on it but not the depth of cut so we will work though this on step at a time. The tool will be starting off to the left of the actual piece of wood touching the bed so the first step is to move the zero point over about half an inch, to approximate where the tool will start. Just select Zero, Point, and Click where you want the new Zero. These are the dimension I will be using for the depths of cut. The first cutting step will be the basic surfacing of the wood to make sure the top is nice and flush. I don\u2019t have much thickness to spare so for surfacing I am only cutting 1.55mm in to the work surface. Because I am starting from the bed the Z origin will be set at the end when ESTLCAM asks for the part height, that will be the Z zero plane (I will be using 11.5mm). So for this part my Z=0 will be 11.5mm from the bed surface. If you had a nice flat piece of material you can make it easier and just start at the work surface. For the cut I select Inside, pocket , and selected the outer most path, shown in red. Make sure to set the tool path depth and machining order starting at one and increment by at least one. The next cut will be a pocket taking the whole surface down in 2 steps, a rough and finishing pass. For the roughing we can start at 1.55mm from the Z=0 plane since that material is already gone from the previous step and go into the material another 4.85mm as see in the part dimensions. For the roughing pass we will leave an allowance of 0.2mm. This lets us come back round for a second pass and only have to mill of .2mm of wood and this leaves a nice smooth Finished surface. So we use an inside pocket pass with .2mm allowance and then a second just inside cut with 0 allowance since the material has already been removed with the roughing pocket no need to cut all that empty space. Current tool path shown in red. Again, always set the machining order. This new pocket will be the depth at which we start the rest of the cuts (6.4mm) Next will be the 4mm hole. We can use a Helical path and start from 6.4mm deep and go a little into the spoil board, I went an extra .2mm for a cut of 5.3mm Now 3 more inside cuts, rough pockets followed by finishing passes. Now that the inner features have been finished it is time to cut the part from the material, leaving 3 small tabs that can easily but snipped off. For this step will will be using an outside cut, with a .2mm allowance, setting the tabs, starting at the Z=0 plane since the outer edge did not get surfaced and cutting .2mm in to the waste board (11.7mm deep). Then the finishing pass with 0 allowance and matching the tabs previously set. Now save your project in case you need to come back and edit your paths. You can do this by using the select tool and changing the popup box parameters. Then export your CNC program (gcode). I use repetier as my visualizer to make sure the cuts look like they should, but to catch small errors if you are new to this I always suggest cutting into high density foam the first run to test your path. Better to waste some time and foam them stress your machine, break a bit, and waste material with some bad gcode. This leaves me with fairly finished part. I can pop it out and use a razor knife to cut off the tabs. I then hit the edges lightly with some 220 git sand paper and call it a day. Here are the files I used, you will probably need to edit these unless your wood is 11.5mm thick. This is the DXF, My generated gcode, and my estlcam project file.

EstlCAM is for generating GCode. This software seems to do everything I want. It also seems to be translated into every language I\u2019ve ever heard of, if not you can add translations in the software. The installer is in German I think but the options are easy to understand. Please buy a copy if you find this works for you. Step one \u2013 Install Estlcam \u00b6 Install Estlcam. Using the default options in the installer, add Icon to start menu and desktop. The first window that pops up I set the language, change the display units, and set it to show the feed rate in mm/s on the tool popups. After you click okay close Estlcam and restart it to update the settings. Step 2 \u2013 Setup \u00b6 After restarting Estlcam, open the setup tab, these are the settings from the first window plus a few extra. Changing the clearance plane to something a little smaller really speeds up a job since the z axis is the slowest. This is how far above the material it should travel to before it moves. You should change the milling direction depending on what kind of material you are cutting, more on this in another post. Setting the z-axis origin to the top of the material makes it easy to set the home position, along with that is program start \u2013 at origin. Choosing to end the program \u201cabove origin\u201d is safe, \u201cabove last position\u201d is the fastest. The creator of Estlcam recently updated his software for us! In the CNC Program Generation tab, choose Marlin (if you are using my firmware). Important \u2013 Set feed unit to mm/min- (this is what the marlin firmware needs). Change the file extension \u201cgcode\u201d so all the programs recognize it. Next up is the travel feed rates. 2100/60=35mm/s, 480=8mm/s (keep the Z low) I delete all the default tools and use this as a conservative test speed setting for an \u215b\u2033 flat endmill in wood.

Step 5 \u2013 Select the tool paths \u00b6 To use the pen you want to drawn on the line so use engrave (tool centered on line), if you were cutting a part you can choose part (tool edge on the outside of line), or cutout (tool edge in inside of line). Click Engrave then just click on each line segment. Step 6 \u2013 Save \u00b6 Export. File>Save CNC Program . Give it a name.

First take the protective cover off of the carbide knife Carefully position it into the cutter body, no need to push a magnet should suck it in. Then use the screw on the end to adjust it so it sticks out the approximate thickness of your material. It isn\u2019t much, more than paper, less than a credit card. Warning Do not touch the end that little knife will slice you very quickly. The button on the end is to push the blade out for removal. Set the Depth Of Cut \u00b6 Try and hold the cutter as perpendicular to the work material as possible and draw a circle on a hard flat smooth surface, glass or similar. If you go through the paper like the second photo you are much too deep, adjust the blade and locking ring again. Keep adjusting and drawing circles to get the depth right. The third picture looks close but if you look at the paper backing in the 4 th picture it is still a bit too deep. Ideal Depth \u00b6 What you are looking for is all the way through the material and a slight dent in the paper backing, but not a cut. It can be tricky if you have never done it before but with a little practice it only takes a try or two. The blade is barely visible. The depth will change depending on your material but you are always looking to just barely leave a mark on the carrier material.

Please clip the ends\u2026.pet peeve\u2026 Two screws on to the MPCNC, ready for action. The Machine \u00b6 The least expensive solution I could find for a nice cutting surface was a cheap 1\u2032 square mirror. Just make sure to set your blade depth correctly, pretty sure the carbide can score the glass and make for a dangerous experience. Tape on all sides is more than enough, there is very little force when it is all set up nicely. The Software \u00b6 I used Estlcam for this sticker. There are other vinyl cutting specific software but, Estlcam works well enough. I think the option for over cuts might be in Estlcam but the lead in works to prevent small tags keeping the part in from the blade offset. Open your dxf of choice and make sure the size is as expected. My grid is set at 25.4mm so this sticker will be about 3\u2033. Engrave would be the idea path option for this but I want to use the lead in so I set the tool diameter as small as permitted, 0.1mm. Select the path with either inside or outside tool. Use the \u201clead in\u201d button to get close to a path overlap. This makes sure the sticker has been completely cut out. I want this as a acid mask so I chose to lead in from the inside of the design. Set the other path. Save the program, chose something small for the depth of cut. For this 0.2mm was used. Run the Gcode \u00b6 You can either load the .gcode into repetier host or save it to an SD card and run it from the LCD. Secure your vinyl/material to your cutting surface. I use painters tape on all sides and try to get the material to lay as flat and taught as possible. I use vinyl similar to this, http://amzn.to/2eHGbJU , I prefer medium tack for easy release. Move the gantry/cutter to the home position, and set the drag knife in contact with the material. Lowering it just enough to just engage the mount spring. Start the program. Making a sticker \u00b6 After the machine is finished you \u201cweed\u201d out the pieces you don\u2019t want. In the pictures I have a positive and a negative. The positive is a typical sticker, the negative is my acid mask. Apply a piece of the transfer tape on the surface, trying to minimize bubbles between layers, not a big deal just best practice. Easiest way is to oversize the transfer tape and use it to tape it to a glass surface. You can do multiple \u201cstickers\u201d at once. trim the transfer tape and the backing at the same time. Bonus points for using a straight edge\u2026 Applying a vinyl sticker \u00b6 Peel the backing paper off. Stick the vinyl and transfer tape to a clean surface. Carefully peel the transfer tape off, pulling at a 90 angle is best practice. Enjoy! Acid Etching Glass \u00b6 Make sure to clean the glass surface thoroughly. Peel the backing and apply the mask from the center for easier alignment. stick down one side from the center out, then the other side. Peel off the transfer tape and make sure all edges are completely stuck so acid can not get under it. I use this acid, http://amzn.to/2fpM1zK . Follow the directions, shake and apply liberally to the surface. Let is sit for about 10 minutes. Wash off with hot water and soap.

These are not assembled by me so a few extra minutes starting from scratch can save a lot of headaches in the end. Start by screwing the base plate to the stepper with the M3x6 screw. I prefer to have the wires oriented up. On the Tension arm add the bearing and broad headed screw. If the bearing does not spin freely, flip it over. One side is slightly offset. Make sure the bearing spins free and smoothly. Some sets include a washer, use it if you have it. Threadlocker is a good idea as well. Add the tension arm and bolt. Make sure the arm swivels smoothly. If the arm binds you can loosen the screw a bit. Thread locker is a good idea here as well. Add the pulley next. Usually the set/grub screws are positioned closer to the motor but not always. Center the teeth on the idler pulley and make certain the pulley does not hit the heat sink that gets installed later. Tighten the set screw on the stepper\u2019s flat spot if it has one, the the second screw. Double check the feed pulley to be sure the teeth are inline with the idler and the pulley does not hit the heat sink. Add the MicroSwiss throat and lock nut. This throat does not contain PTFE so it can handle higher temperatures and should not need any maintenance. To help with heat dissipation the lock nut is positioned on the inside of the bracket. Thread the throat is as far as it can go. Do not let the throat make contact with the idler or pulley. The smaller this gap the better soft and flexible filaments will print and the better the heat will dissipate from the throat when printing PLA slowly. Next up is the tension stack.

So straight 2 color images with no gradients are best. Just plain old black and white. The higher the resolution the sharper the edges. Resize and adjust \u00b6 Next is open the image in Photoshop (or any image editor Paint.net is a free alternative), then resize it match the size you need. It is best to set the pixel resolution in your image editor as well. I use 100 px/cm or 0.1mm. I find the best quality with my setup at that resolution. Typically, a higher resolution is recommended but I had unsatisfactory results. While in your editor you can also adjust your levels to make the whites as white as possible and the blacks as black as possible. Image2GCode \u00b6 After you have your image sized and ready to go open up Image2GCode and load your image. The linked version has been modified for the Mostly Printed CNC. Remember you are engraving the backside of the mirror so you have to flip your image horizontally so it appears the correct way on the front of the mirror. If you do not, it will be backwards and you will need to start over. You can also Turn the gamma way down too this will help darken the blacks more if need be. You want the laser blasting as strongly as possible on the mirror. Next on the Laser profile tab you want to leave Min Power at 0 and change Max Power to 255 or select the Max radio button. No other changes required to the defaults here. On the last and final GCODE tab there are a few changes I make here. In the Gcode header section I add the following code: G0 X0 Y0 M201 X1000 Y1000 M204 P1000 T1000 This code turns up the default MPCNC acceleration. You may need to tweak these settings for your machine, these work well for mine. Your feedrate may vary slightly depending on the finish of the mirror. A good starting point would be 1200 mm/min. Click the Use S Param radio button. Type 106 S in the Laser Power on MCODE box and type M107 in the Laser Power Off MCODE box. I like to use diagonal scanning for best quality. You can choose to engrave an edge line if you like or not by selecting the check box. Click Generate file, give your file a name and the GCODE will be output. G Code Sender \u00b6 Before running your file you should have already focused your laser to the height of the mirror surface. Now you can either load the G code onto an SD card and run it from your lcd or open Repetier Host. In repetier click -File, -Load then find your file. Setting your laser to the 0,0 point on your mirror and click print. Several hours later you should end up with something that resembles your file like this.

These can and will blind and or burn you in less than 1/100 th of a second, It takes ten times that long to even react by blinking if it is in the visible spectrum. Did I make my point yet? Safety glasses are paramount. This is not the place to try and save money. You need a high quality pair and anyone else that could be around it needs the same quality. The cheaper your laser is the more money you will need to spend on the safety glasses. Import lasers are notorious for being dirty, mislabeled, and this makes them more dangerous. High quality lasers are of a known wavelength and strength therefore they are easy to protect yourself from, imports can contain other wavelengths that your goggles may or may not protect you from or be more powerful than your glasses are rated for. I am no expert, have no way of testing, and therefore no real say in who makes quality glasses, I can not make a recommendation at this time. This video might help drive home the point. While we are on the subject, the laser looks extremely harmless in the goggles, kids (and most adults) will try to take off the glasses immediately so no youngsters (or tough guys) unless the laser is fully enclosed behind a laser shield and you trust them to listen. In the glasses the laser is just a bright dot but you can see in your periphery the entire room lights up. You never know when the laser could hit something slightly reflective, your mount could fail, the gcode could cram it into the surface and break your mount, your air assist could drop into and reflect the beam sending send a death beam in any direction. Lungs & Skin \u00b6 The other end of the safety spectrum is the material you are working with. You can\u2019t just go etching and cutting things willy nilly. Ever think you could make chlorine gas or cyanide in your own house\u2026.now you can. Laser cutting vinyl or ABS plastic does just that. Two extremely common materials. Here is the list I refer to most often, if you have a link to a better guide please let me know. Best practice is to contain all the laser smoke and direct it through a filter and vent it outside, at the very least vent it outside. You do not want to breath any of the smoke any modern man made material makes. Fire \u00b6 Now this one might be a little bit of a surprise to some and obvious to others. Lasers are burning your material, add air assist directly to the burn zone and strong ventilation fans and you end up with the best recipe for fire ever. Pay close attention never leave it unattended and have the appropriate type of fire suppression on hand. Fire is not extremely common on good cuts but if it does happen it happens stupid fast with all that force fed oxygen. Basics \u00b6 Types \u00b6 Two of the most common lasers in the maker world are CO2 and Diode lasers. Diode lasers are much more compact, have self contained interchangeable optics, and are an order of magnitude lower power than a typical CO2 laser. More on the Power in a bit. These lasers operate at different wavelengths and this can have an effect of the type of material they are suitable for. Diode based lasers can range in price from a few dollars up to a few hundred, and CO2 based lasers start at a few hundred and go up from there. Both lasers have some sort of focal lens but a CO2 laser also has a mirror system to steer the beam before focus. Diodes can be cooled with a small fan, CO2 use water and sometimes a chiller. Typically on any of the V1 Engineering machines you would be using a diode based laser. If your goal is to cut wood or plastic you should be looking at a CO2 laser. A Diode is best at marking/etching, and is only capable of cutting light materials (foam, paper, plastic) and very thin wood. Power \u00b6 Laser power, not as straight forward as you would think. Higher numbers in general mean thicker materials can be cut or etching can be done faster. Numbers are not everything! A laser has four things to consider when talking about it\u2019s power; wattage, spot size, focal length, spectrum. Wattage The overall power output of your laser (like a light bulb, energy per time). On most non-laser specific machines we are limited by speed. Okay stick with me, just like strapping on a chainsaw motor to the MPCNC stronger is not always better. Since we can only move so fast before we start to get motion degradation you need to size your laser accordingly. A strong laser moving slowly will have an extremely limited range of grey levels. For example at the same speed a higher powered laser will have to use power 1-20 so you don\u2019t start a fire (19 levels of grey), but a lower powered laser will be able to use power 1-255 (254 levels of grey) without starting a fire. Make sense? Spot size How small of a spot the wattage is concentrated on. Spot size dictates the resolution of the image you can produce, think printer DPI (dots per inch). Another side effect of spot size can be ability to cut. A poorly focused laser\u2019s power is too spread out to be effective, a finely focused laser cuts significantly better. For a diode this can vary 100-400 micron in diameter just by laser wattage. To be more clear, more powerful diode lasers can not be focused to as small of a point as lower powered lasers (the source is not truly a point, larger diodes equal larger initial \u201cpoints\u201d, and it is not actually a spot but a rectangular spot). Focal length This influences the shape of the laser cone (long and narrow or short and fat). The focal length is dependent on the lens you use and should be a small range depending on the lens. If you have a choice, a longer focal length can aid in cutting ability (a thinner steeper beam/cone can cut deeper before power is lost to the edges of the material). Spectrum The wavelength of the light it produces (diodes-UV to viable, CO2- mid-infrared). Materials react differently to every spectrum as do safety glasses. If you have a specific need do your research before buying. Duty cycle One more thing on the topic of power, duty cycle or continuous time on. On the cheap import look out for sensational things like \u201c15W $50!\u201d somewhere in the description it could say \u201cOne second continuous operation time\u201d. This means they are over driving the heck out of the laser, it will not last long, and at 1 second bursts it is not very useful. Guard your wallet from these Scammy Chumps. I just found another ad that says no more than 30min continuous, that might sound like a lot at first but you can do some really detailed things that take a few hours. Air Assist \u00b6 To get cleaner etching, deeper cuts, and to save your lens you need some sort of air assist. While using your laser your material will produce smoke. This smoke if not directed away will stick to the material you are working with producing a sooty poor looking cut or etching. This smoke will also stick to the laser\u2019s lens and very quickly build up heat before you know it the lens will break. Bare minimum you need to have a 40mm fan clearing the area, even better are radial fans (higher pressure more direct), or even better yet a small compressor . If you have the ability to hook up your compressor and aim the air stream you can get significantly better cuts this way. Once again don\u2019t forget to vent your fumes safely and accordingly. The Hard Part \u00b6 Choosing \u00b6 Choosing which laser to buy can be the hardest part. If this all already seems overwhelming just buy a JTechPhotonics kit . Why; it is a trusted laser/company, glasses proven suitable for it, complete kits available, the only kit that is US legal , and the connections and use are as simple as it gets (more later). I think the 2W kits are a great deal. If you have other companies to suggest please let me know, and I will check them out. PWM, TTL, WTF? \u00b6 PWM, and TTL in this context are just how the power of the laser is controlled. All we really care about is if the laser is controlled by 5V or 12V. Good brands and companies make this abundantly clear, if you are buying an import this is by far the hardest part of the whole thing. The specs are not clear, the wiring diagrams are typically non-existent and if they are they can be wrong, we even have drivers with PCB\u2019s with misprinted polarity so you can\u2019t even follow that. Unfortunately import lasers, while super cheap, tend to be a guess and check game, both with connections and lens specs. With all common boards we can handle 12V and 5V signals, no big deal! 12V signal driven lasers are less common (Jtech). They are simple, you plug them into the print fan port (or any 12V port) on your control board and you are good to go. Using a 12V port you will typically use M106 SXXX to turn the laser on and M107 to turn the laser off. The Sxxx is the laser strength with a value between 0-255, 255 being the most power. 5V driven lasers need a firmware edit to assign the right pin for your board, this just reassigns the 12v fan pin to instead control a 5V pin. After that the same rules apply, use M106 SXXX to turn the laser on and M107 to turn the laser off. The Sxxx is the laser strength with a value between 0-255, 255 being the most power.

These can and will blind and or burn you in less than 1/100 th of a second, It takes ten times that long to even react by blinking if it is in the visible spectrum. Did I make my point yet? Safety glasses are paramount. This is not the place to try and save money. You need a high quality pair and anyone else that could be around it needs the same quality. The cheaper your laser is the more money you will need to spend on the safety glasses. Import lasers are notorious for being dirty, mislabeled, and this makes them more dangerous. High quality lasers are of a known wavelength and strength therefore they are easy to protect yourself from, imports can contain other wavelengths that your goggles may or may not protect you from or be more powerful than your glasses are rated for. I am no expert, have no way of testing, and therefore no real say in who makes quality glasses, I can not make a recommendation at this time. This video might help drive home the point. While we are on the subject, the laser looks extremely harmless in the goggles, kids (and most adults) will try to take off the glasses immediately so no youngsters (or tough guys) unless the laser is fully enclosed behind a laser shield and you trust them to listen. In the glasses the laser is just a bright dot but you can see in your periphery the entire room lights up. You never know when the laser could hit something slightly reflective, your mount could fail, the gcode could cram it into the surface and break your mount, your air assist could drop into and reflect the beam sending send a death beam in any direction.","title":"Eyes"},{"location":"tools/lasers/#lungs-skin","text":"The other end of the safety spectrum is the material you are working with.

Diode lasers are much more compact, have self contained interchangeable optics, and are an order of magnitude lower power than a typical CO2 laser. More on the Power in a bit. These lasers operate at different wavelengths and this can have an effect of the type of material they are suitable for. Diode based lasers can range in price from a few dollars up to a few hundred, and CO2 based lasers start at a few hundred and go up from there. Both lasers have some sort of focal lens but a CO2 laser also has a mirror system to steer the beam before focus. Diodes can be cooled with a small fan, CO2 use water and sometimes a chiller. Typically on any of the V1 Engineering machines you would be using a diode based laser. If your goal is to cut wood or plastic you should be looking at a CO2 laser. A Diode is best at marking/etching, and is only capable of cutting light materials (foam, paper, plastic) and very thin wood.","title":"Types"},{"location":"tools/lasers/#power","text":"Laser power, not as straight forward as you would think. Higher numbers in general mean thicker materials can be cut or etching can be done faster. Numbers are not everything! A laser has four things to consider when talking about it\u2019s power; wattage, spot size, focal length, spectrum. Wattage The overall power output of your laser (like a light bulb, energy per time). On most non-laser specific machines we are limited by speed. Okay stick with me, just like strapping on a chainsaw motor to the MPCNC stronger is not always better. Since we can only move so fast before we start to get motion degradation you need to size your laser accordingly. A strong laser moving slowly will have an extremely limited range of grey levels. For example at the same speed a higher powered laser will have to use power 1-20 so you don\u2019t start a fire (19 levels of grey), but a lower powered laser will be able to use power 1-255 (254 levels of grey) without starting a fire. Make sense? Spot size How small of a spot the wattage is concentrated on. Spot size dictates the resolution of the image you can produce, think printer DPI (dots per inch). Another side effect of spot size can be ability to cut. A poorly focused laser\u2019s power is too spread out to be effective, a finely focused laser cuts significantly better. For a diode this can vary 100-400 micron in diameter just by laser wattage. To be more clear, more powerful diode lasers can not be focused to as small of a point as lower powered lasers (the source is not truly a point, larger diodes equal larger initial \u201cpoints\u201d, and it is not actually a spot but a rectangular spot). Focal length This influences the shape of the laser cone (long and narrow or short and fat). The focal length is dependent on the lens you use and should be a small range depending on the lens. If you have a choice, a longer focal length can aid in cutting ability (a thinner steeper beam/cone can cut deeper before power is lost to the edges of the material). Spectrum The wavelength of the light it produces (diodes-UV to viable, CO2- mid-infrared). Materials react differently to every spectrum as do safety glasses.

This subject can get very deep and intimidating so I will try and present this in a tiered manner. Improving as we learn collectively and as the software (CAM) improves. I am no expert. I learn by reading and trial and error. Test cuts speak volumes and should be considered a requirement. You should have test cuts that are small but representative of your part. If you are doing a 3D sculpt isolate a small part and mill it out, if you are cutting out a part with a pocket and some holes make a small part with a pocket and a hole. These test cuts can save hours on the actual job, every time you do one I promise you will learn something. Baby Steps \u00b6 You should have already done some plotting, as shown here . You should have a very clean drawing if you don\u2019t you should not be milling yet. Make sure the pen picks up all the way (clearance plane), and the parts are the right size. This ensure your machine works correctly and you are familiar with the basics of CAM and how your machine moves. After plotting the next step in milling would be HD foam , (I find it at the big box store \u201cfoamular\u201d $5 for a \u00bc sheet), this material holds amazing tolerances, mills very well, and will not destroy your machine when you make a mistake. If you are new this should always be the material you make a first test cut in, then on to test cuts in the material you want to use. You can make test cuts on both sides and the $5 it costs will pay for is self many times over in saved bits and refined CAM settings (time & accuracy). Some of the first cuts ever made on an MPCNC. For The Impatient \u00b6 If you just want to get the machine dirty here is the generic recipe. This should work in every material, you can optimize later. Single flute \u215b\u2033 upcut bit . 8mm/s Feed Rate (The speed at which you move through the material). 3mm/s Plunge Rate (The speed at which you move vertically into the material). 1mm Depth of Cut (The thickness of material your bit will be removing per pass). 45% Step Over (The percentage of bit diameter that should be in contact with the material) Use the Peel pocketing strategy. Always use a finishing pass of \u224810% of your tools diameter. The more dense the material the smaller the finishing pass. At this point you should be in HD foam, if that works out you can try some soft wood like pine. If that works at this point the only variable you should be changing is the depth of cut . You can vary this and it will increase the load on your machine in trade for more material removed per pass or decrease the load by taking shallower bites. Peel, Is usually the best pocketing strategy. When you get that out of your system come back and learn things a little more in depth. A More Proper Introduction \u00b6 These are some of the first things you should understand when just getting started. I am going to collect and link all the great resources I think illustrate the point the best. Most of these pictures should link to an outside site for more information. If you disagree with any of the following information please let me know\u2026politely. Islands \u00b6 An island is that pesky little thing in the center of a cut, like the middle on an \u201cO\u201d, or the center of the logo. Super easy only takes 3 steps. Using the Part tool select the inner feature. Next is the Hole tool, select the outer feature. Then in the Properties box select Island . Work offsets \u00b6 A work offset is simply moving your origin. This is typically used when there are more than one operation in your job, multiple fixtures can be used, locating pins, or other locating methods. More typically for us to avoid Negative X and Y moves when using endstops. Not Offset Offset (Good for Dual Endstops) Finishing Pass \u00b6 A finishing pass allows you to complete your job faster with more accuracy. What?! By leaving a bit of material on your roughing cut you can then cut off a very small amount of material leaving you with a very accurate final cut with a better surface finish. This means you can rough out your part faster (high machine loads increase deflection) and the finishing skim cut (extremely low machine loads) will bring it to final dimension. All cuts should have this, most importantly slotting operations. Just select your finishing tool, usually the current tool you are using. Shown in the yellow box. Use a 5-25% tool diameter allowance. Shown in the yellow box. The finishing pass is show in the picture as the lighter red path. Climb vs. Conventional Milling \u00b6 For the most part you always want to Climb mill. The edge of the cutter starts with a large bite and ends small, reducing work hardening and heat retention. Conventional milling Climb milling Feeds and Speeds Calculator \u00b6 I can not stress this enough, these numbers are different for every build. Only use them as a guide to find the right settings for your build. You can make a few test cuts a quickly work out how to get reliable numbers for your machine with the right settings though. https://fswizard.com/www/ Stepover \u00b6 Basic All things being equal, this is the amount of material your tool encounters in percentage of the tool diameter. The lower the percentage the lower the force on the machine, the more accurate the cut. Expanded A good thing to know is most flutes are not 50% of the diameter of the bit, usually less. Just typing in a percentage does not mean that is the actual chip load, Feedrate, RPM, and Depth of Cut all play a major part. All the numbers you enter are a fine balance of an equation giving you total chip load per tooth. Roughing is 50% or less, typically 45% depending on material density. More than 50% you will be both climb and conventional milling and should be avoided. Finishing is 20% or less depending on amount if detail and tolerances desired (I typically use 2-8% time vs. quality), ball endmills should use 10% or less to minimize scalloping. 50% stepover 25% stepover Dual EndStop Tool Changes, Z Probing \u00b6 For this method you will need the Dual EndStop firmware, an LCD, optionally a digital spindle speed controller. Starting Gcode \u00b6 The pause here is to allow you to remove the Z probe wires. G90 ; Absolute positioning, just in case G92 X0 Y0 Z0 ; Set Current position to 0, all axes G00 Z5.0000 F500 ; Raise Z 5mm at 8.3mm/s to clear clamps and screws G28 X Y Z ; Home in order, w/zprobe G92 Z0.15 ; Account for probe thickness (set your thickness) G00 Z5.0000 F500 ; Raise Z probe off off of surface M00 ; pause for LCD button press M03 S<s> ; PID, set spindle speed Tool Change \u00b6 The steppers are disabled so you can move the head to an area where you can more easily change the tool, make sure you do not let your Z axis drop onto your work surface. If you need you can insert another pause before the steppers are disabled to make sure you are there to catch it. This first pause is to let you physically change the tool and install the Z probe. The second pause is to allow you to remove the Z probe. M05 ; PID, Stop spindle G0 Z35 F500 ; Raise Z axis 35mm M84 ; Disable steppers M00 ; Wait for LCD button press ;Change tool: <n> G28 X Y Z ; Home in order, w/zprobe G92 Z0.15 ; Account for probe thickness (set your thickness) G00 Z5.0000 F500 ; Raise Z probe off off of surface M00 ; pause for LCD button press M03 S<s> ; PID, set spindle speed Ending \u00b6 Make sure you tune the final Z lift to your machine. M05 ; PID, Turn off spindle G0 Z30 ; Lift Z axis 30mm ; M84 ; Optionally turn off steppers. If you do not have a PID controller you do not have to remove or worry about the code. This is the basics, you can easily modify this. Depth of Cut \u00b6 Equal steps \u2013 Depth of cut, DOC, Should be planned for. Making equal steps will produce the best results. Just because you can cut deeper doesn\u2019t mean you should. Know the deepest you can cut your material and from there divide the cut equally. The only way to save time is less passes, if you can not save a pass make the step smaller. Equal Steps Pointless Steps Through all \u2013 Through all cuts, cuts that are intended to go all the way through the material, should move past the bottom of your material. The amount past depends on the flatness of your build, all build have some sort of variance. A 0.5mm-4mm would be pretty typical. Factor this into your equal DOC from above. Through All Post Processors \u00b6 When making Gcode from your CAM program it spits out raw coordinates, speeds, and a few other commands. A post processor simply formats in a way that your firmware will recognize it. For example, Marlin treat G0 (rapid move) and G1 (Work move) the same. Other machines set the G0 speed in the firmware, Marlin does not. To over come this we Use a line in the post processor to set the actual speed in each line so it doesn\u2019t matter. There are all sorts of things like this. All machines require a post processor. The ones we have working \u00b6 Please share your links to other PP\u2019s. I know there are more.
